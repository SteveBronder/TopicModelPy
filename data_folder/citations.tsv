Monaco	The Journal of Experimental Education	63	3	1995-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 185-197	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		Rates of forgetting among fast and slow learners have been shown to be equivalent if learners are equated for amount of original learning on a memorization task. This finding is quite robust across a variety of learning tasks, materials, and experimental procedures. The authors of the present study replicated these findings with fourth and fifth graders, showing that, once they learned a poem to the same criterion level (75-90% correct), the fast and slow learners recalled approximately the same amount of the poem after 7 days. The experiment was extended by having the students relearn the poem to the same criterion level and testing their retention. After students were re-equated on relearning the poem, however, fast learners recalled significantly more than slow learners at both 14-day and 28-day intervals. Thus, the forgetting curves for fast and slow learners were the same after original learning, but different after relearning. Possible causes of this difference are discussed in terms of the literature on learning and metacognitive strategies.

Sharpe, Inc.	fla		Recent empirical research shows that industry and regulatory shocks play a key role in determining merger activity in developed countries. We use this framework to analyze merger activity in India, using a comprehensive database spanning a thirty-year period, from 1973–74 to 2002–3. At the industry level, we identify clustering of merger activity in India, indicating that mergers may be a response to industry and regulatory shocks. At the firm level, the 1991 amendments to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act, which removed premerger scrutiny, are found to have a positive and significant effect on merger behavior of firms that had been under its purview. After the 1991 amendments, firms underwent mergers that would have been scrutinized by the MRTP Act otherwise. These mergers were undertaken for expansionary reasons.

In the present study, data from the two waves of the National Survey of Children are used to investigate the impact of family transitions on changes in emotional and behavioral problems as reported by the mothers. The results show that there are sex differentials in the changes in emotional well-being that can be attributed to family transitions. The results also indicate that an increase in emotional and behavioral problems can be attributed to remarriage but not to divorce.

Using the accession of the postcommunist countries as a test case, this article argues that the EU can send strong signals to financial markets about the trajectory of a particular country. Examining spreads on sovereign debt from 1990 to 2006, this article shows that closing negotiation chapters on domestic economic policy—in other words, receiving a seal of approval from Brussels that previously existing policy reform is acceptable to the wider EU—substantially decreases perceptions of default risk in those countries. That decrease operates independently from policy reform that the country has taken and is also distinct from selection processes (modeled here with new variables, including UNESCO World Heritage sites and domestic movie production, that proxy for cultural factors). Thus, this particular international organization has played an important role in coordinating market sentiment on members, conferring confidence that policy reform alone could not accomplish.

Horowitz	The Journal of Human Resources	33	1	1998-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 39-61	University of Wisconsin Press	fla		The optimal minimum distance (OMD) estimator for models of covariance structures is asymptotically efficient but has much worse finite-sample properties than does the equally weighted minimum distance (EWMD) estimator. This paper shows how the bootstrap can be used to improve the finite-sample performance of the OMD estimator. The theory underlying the bootstrap's ability to reduce the bias of estimators and errors in the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals is summarized. The results of numerical experiments and an empirical example show that the bootstrap often essentially eliminates the bias of the OMD estimator. The finite-sample estimation efficiency of the bias-corrected OMD estimator often exceeds that of the EWMD estimator. Moreover, the true coverage probabilities of confidence intervals based on the OMD estimator with bootstrap-critical values are very close to the nominal coverage probabilities.

Murphy	The American Statistician	41	3	1987-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 187-189	American Statistical Association	fla		The so-called umbrella problem (or cost-loss ratio situation), in which an individual must decide whether to take an umbrella in the face of uncertainty concerning whether it will rain today, is sometimes used as a textbook example of decision making under uncertainty. This problem is extended to provide a simple demonstration of the way in which the economic value of imperfect information changes as its quality increases.

The approach consists of fusing the lysosomal protease cathepsin B (CB) to a subunit of a multimeric protein. The CB fusion polypeptide can proteolytically digest the multimer and/or detour the multimer from its usual subcellular destination to the lysosome. We first demonstrate the general validity of the approach with CB fusion to E. coli lacZ, encoding tetrameric β-galactosidase. Cotransfection of NIH 3T3 cells with a vector expressing a CB-lacZ fusion inhibits the β-galactosidase activity produced by transfection of lacZ alone. We infer that the dominant negative inhibition results from both direct proteolysis of the β-galactosidase tetramer by the fusion subunit and detour of the tetramer to the lysosome. In a specific application of this strategy, we have fused CB to the dimeric bHLH skeletal muscle transcription factor MyoD. The CB-MyoD fusion protein localizes to the cytoplasm, presumably the lysosome, demonstrating the dominance of lysosomal localization to nuclear localization. The CB-MyoD fusion appears to divert homodimerizing native MyoD from its usual nuclear destination, consequently inhibiting MyoD-mediated transactivation and in vitro differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Surprisingly, the CB-MyoD fusion fails to interact with the bHLH heterodimerization partners, E12 and E47, suggesting preferential MyoD homodimer formation, at least in the prenuclear cellular compartments.

Reichard	Biotropica	41	4	2009-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 503-513	The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation	fla		Although members of the family Hylobatide are known to be monogamous, adult white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, also show multimale groups and polyandry. A need for more than one male to successfully raise offspring cannot explain the occurrence of polyandry in these territorial primates, because direct paternal care is absent in this species. We hypothesize that polyandry is primarily related to costs/benefits for males of cooperatively defending a female and/or resources; our prediction was that polyandry would become more frequent with increasing costs of female/resource defense. We measured the ecological quality of seven gibbon home ranges over a 3-yr period (2001–2003) to investigate how resource availability affected the probability of polyandry, and found a significant negative relationship between home range quality and home range size. Larger home ranges were of lower quality. As predicted, groups living on larger, poorer home ranges also experienced longer periods of polyandry. In forest areas of comparatively low quality, acquiring and maintaining a large home range that includes enough resources for a female to reproduce steadily may surpass a single male's capacity. Our model of cooperative male polyandry was supported by preliminary data of shared territorial defense and access to the female. However, interaction proportions were strongly skewed, and female's primary male partners monopolized grooming and mating. Nevertheless, a primary male on a large territory may benefit from the presence of a secondary male with aid in territorial/female defense, whereas a secondary male may gain by avoiding high dispersal costs.

Spence, Bazartseren Boldgiv, Ariuntsetseg Lkhagva, Brent R. Helliker, Brenda B. Casper, Peter S. Petraitis	Ecology	93	4	2012-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 815-824	Ecological Society of America	fla		The semiarid, northern Mongolian steppe, which still supports pastoral nomads who have used the steppe for millennia, has experienced an average 1.7°C temperature rise over the past 40 years. Continuing climate change is likely to affect flowering phenology and flower numbers with potentially important consequences for plant community composition, ecosystem services, and herder livelihoods. Over the growing seasons of 2009 and 2010, we examined flowering responses to climate manipulation using open-top passive warming chambers (OTCs) at two locations on a south-facing slope: one on the moister, cooler lower slope and the other on the drier, warmer upper slope, where a watering treatment was added in a factorial design with warming. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) revealed that OTCs reduced flower production and delayed peak flowering in graminoids as a whole but only affected forbs on the upper slope, where peak flowering was also delayed. OTCs affected flowering phenology in seven of eight species, which were examined individually, either by altering the time of peak flowering and/or the onset and/or cessation of flowering, as revealed by survival analysis. In 2010, which was the drier year, OTCs reduced flower production in two grasses but increased production in an annual forb found only on the upper slope. The particular effects of OTCs on phenology, and whether they caused an extension or contraction of the flowering season, differed among species, and often depended on year, or slope, or watering treatment; however, a relatively strong pattern emerged for 2010 when four species showed a contraction of the flowering season in OTCs. Watering increased flower production in two species in 2010, but slope location more often affected flowering phenology than did watering. Our results show the importance of taking landscape-scale variation into account in climate change studies and also contrasted with those of several studies set in cold, but wetter systems, where warming often causes greater or accelerated flower production. In cold, water-limited systems like the Mongolian steppe, warming may reduce flower numbers or the length of the flowering season by adding to water stress more than it relieves cold stress.

Wunker	Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations	2	2	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 89-107	Springer	fla		The non-profit sector arising in Poland and Hungary bears little resemblance to its pre-war ancestors. The new non-profits are shaped by social and economic forces brought about by the state socialists. State socialist service policies have left the non-profits with substantial need for their services, but the organisations face several major constraints in meeting that demand. Current government policies towards services and non-profits are discussed. Government and foreign funders can play a significant role in fostering the new non-profits, but a careful prioritisation of objectives is necessary. The present situation shows that many theories about non-profit organisations are not internationally cross-applicable, although several hypotheses have partial relevance. Le secteur bénévole qui se développe en Pologne et en Hongrie n'a que peu de choses à voir avec son prédécesseur d'avant-guerre. Ce nouveau secteur est marqué par des forces socio-économiques qui sont le résultat du socialisme d'Etat. La politique du socialisme d'Etat en matière de services a conduit à une forte demande de prestations de la part des entités bénévoles, mais celles-ci se trouvent confrontées à plusieurs contraintes importantes lorsqu'il s'agit de faire face à cette demande. L'article traite de la politique actuelle des gouvernements vis à vis des services et du secteur bénévole. Les crédits publics ou étrangers ont un rôle important à jouer dans le développement de ce nouveau secteur, mais il est important de définir la hiérarchie des priorités. La situation actuelle nous montre que beaucoup de théories concernant les organisations bénévoles ne peuvent s'appliquer de manière globale à tous les pays, mais que plusieurs hypothèses s'appliquent au moins partiellement. Der dritte Sektor in Polen und Ungarn hat kaum Áhnlichkeit mit seinen vor-sozialistischen Vorgängern. Die neu entstandenen Organisationen werden von sozialen und ökonomischen Kräften bestimmt, die vom Staatssozialismus hervorgebracht wurden. Die Dienstleistungspolitik des Staatssozialismus hat zu einer starken Nachfrageerhöhung bei gleichzeitiger Unterversorgung von Dienstleistungen geführt. Der Aufsatz diskutiert die gegenwärtige Regierungspolitik in Bezug auf soziale Dienste und Nonprofit-Organisationen. Staat und ausländische Geldgeber können eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Unterstützung der neuen Organisationen des Nonprofit-Sektors spielen, allerdings ist eine sorgfältige Abwägung der Prioritäten bei der Zielsetzung notwendig. Die gegenwärtige Situation zeigt, daß viele Theorien über Nonprofit-Organisationen international nicht übertragbar sind, allerdings haben einige Hypothesen partielle Bedeutung. El sector no lucrativo que emerge en Polonia y Hungría guarda pocas semejanzas con su ancestro de la pre-guerra. Las nuevas organizaciones no lucrativas están marcadas por las fuerzas económicas y sociales impulsadas por los estados socialistas. Las políticas de servicios de los estados socialistas han dejado a las organizaciones no lucrativas con una sustancial demanda por sus servicios, pero estas se encuentran con varias limitaciones importantes para satisfacerla. Las actuales políticas gubernamentales hacia los servicios y las organizaciones no lucrativas son discutidas en este trabajo. El gobierno y los donantes extranjeros pueden jugar un papel destacado en la promoción de estas nuevas organizaciones, pero se precisa una priorización clara de los objetivos. La situación presente muestra que muchas de las teorías sobre las organizaciones no-lucrativas no son aplicables internacionalmente, aunque algunas hipótesis tienen una relevancia parcial.

Gastineau, Albert Madansky	Financial Analysts Journal	40	4	1984-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 58-67	CFA Institute	fla		The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Call Option Index provides an estimate of the average value of standardized, six-month, at-the-money call options, expressed as a percentage of the price of the underlying stocks. The CBOE index does not attempt to eliminate the effects of changing interest rates and changes in the pattern and timing of dividends. The Gastineau-Madansky index, on the other hand, eliminates these effects and focuses on changes in the market's expectation for the volatility of the underlying stocks. One can gain some appreciation of the effect of interest rates and dividends on the CBOE index by looking at the level of and the net difference between the short-term interest rate and the average dividend yield. Since 1978, when short-term rates began to rise relative to dividend yields, the CBOE and the Gastineau-Madansky indexes have diverged materially. The high short-term rates of 1979 caused the CBOE index to exceed the levels that prevailed during most of 1977; the Gastineau-Madansky index, in contrast, showed that expected stock price volatility was at a historical low in the second quarter of 1979. Most investors who use an option premium index in their analyses use it as a measure of expected or implied stock price volatility. But the CBOE Call Option Index is too dependent on the dividend-interest rate differential to be a meaningful indicator of the market's expectations for future stock price volatility.

(TESOL)	fla		Is technology a tool for language learning, or is language learning a tool with which people can access technology? This article suggests that both language and technology are tools for individual and societal development. The article introduces a developmental approach to integrating technology in language education, based on consideration of both product and process. It then illustrates these concepts through analysis of a large, U.S.-funded English language developmental program in Egypt. Two projects are examined: a teacher education program on computers in English language teaching and a basic English methodology course taught via videoconferencing. The analysis indicates that a developmental approach is critical to successful integration and use of technology in language education programs.

Mani Subramanian	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	197	5	2008-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 721-727	Oxford University Press	fla		Background. HGS004 is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody against CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) with robust in vitro activity against a diverse panel of CCR5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. Methods. A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in patients infected with CCR5tropic HIV-1 to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of HGS004. Sixty-three subjects were randomized into 5 dose cohorts (0.4, 2, 8, 20, and 40 mg/kg) and received a single intravenous dose of HGS004 or placebo. Results. HGS004 was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Pharmacokinetics were nonlinear across the 0.4-40-mg/kg dose range, with dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration, although the area under the curve increased more than proportionally to dose. High levels of receptor occupancy were observed for up to 28 days in the higher-dose cohorts. Plasma HIV-1 RNA reductions of >1               <tex-math>$log_{10}$</tex-math>               at day 14 were observed in 14 (54%) of 26 subjects in the 8-, 20-, and 40-mg/kg cohorts. In the 40-mg/kg cohort, 4 of 10 subjects had a >1               <tex-math>$log_{10}$</tex-math>               HIV-1 RNA reduction at day 28. Drug concentrations relative to isolate sensitivity (the ratio of the concentration at day 14 to               <tex-math>$IC_{90}$</tex-math>               ) predicted antiviral response on day 14. Conclusions. HGS004 is safe and well tolerated and demonstrates meaningful antiviral activity when administered to patients infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1.

Factorial analysis of variance confirmed the statistical significance of these differences. Implications of Race X Test (suggesting S.E.S. X Test) interaction effects for program evaluation and instruction are briefly discussed.

Smith, Linda Partridge	Proceedings: Biological Sciences	265	1408	1998-10-07T00:00:00Z	pp. 1879-1894	The Royal Society	fla		Costs of reproduction include costs of producing eggs and of mating itself. In the present study, we made an experimental investigation of costs of reproduction in the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly, Ceratitis capitata). We demonstrated that virgins live longer than non-virgin females. However, in strong contrast to most findings within the Diptera, non-virginity had no detectable effect on egg production. Therefore the increased longevity of the virgin females cannot be attributed to an increase in egg production in non-virgin females, and instead indicates a cost of mating. A comparison of the life spans of normal females and those sterilized by low doses of X-irradiation, revealed an additional cost of egg production. There were no significant differences in remating levels between females that did and did not lay eggs, showing that the cost of producing eggs is independent of mating frequency. Medfly females therefore suffer a decrease in survival as a result of egg production and of mating, and these costs are independent of one another. To put our results into context, we reviewed the existing literature on the effects of mating on longevity, egg production and sexual receptivity for 64 species of Diptera, and examined the pattern of mating effects that emerged.

Results of hierarchical linear modeling showed that in Grades 6 and 8, discrepancies in students' sense of belonging were mainly within schools, rather than between schools. At the student level, sense of belonging in both grades was affected more by students' mental and physical conditions and less by their individual and family characteristics. Students' self-esteem was the single most important predictor of their sense of belonging, followed by their health status. At the school level, school climate (academic press or expectation in Grade 6 and disciplinary climate in Grade 8) was more important than school context in shaping students' sense of belonging.

The increase has been most marked in children 0-14 years of age, and there is evidence that, as with lead poisoning, inner-city and urban populations are most at risk. Attention has turned to the role of indoor environment risk factors, especially in homes and schools. Such factors include moisture and mold growth, pest infestation, dust mites, the building envelope, heating systems, inadequate ventilation, NO2 and environmental tobacco smoke. The Healthy Public Housing Initiative (HPHI) is a Boston-based community-centered research and intervention project designed to engage Boston Housing Authority residents in a collaborative process to improve respiratory health, quality of life, building conditions, and building maintenance in public housing. This article summarizes the significant research findings from four pilot studies in housing developments that lay the foundation for the larger HPHI asthma-related environmental intervention study. The research design for the pilot projects is informed by principles of community-collaborative research. The strengths of this model of research to our work are also discussed.

Slade	Ecology	69	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1266-1274	Ecological Society of America	fla		Monte Carlo simulations were used to demonstrate that regression methods could be successfully used to estimate competition coefficients with collinear data, but only under conditions that may be difficult to meet with ecological data. Ordinary least squares performs well when estimating coefficients associated with noncollinear predictor variables. Stepwise regression and maximum eigenvalue least squares reduce collinearity by deleting information that, even though not statistically significant, may be important in accurately estimating interaction. We propose that apparent competition (Holt 1977) and the failure of regression techniques to detect competition when it is known to exist experimentally may be due to the omission or lack of measurement of critical elements of the community matrix.

Singer, Björn Öbrink	The Journal of Cell Biology	187	4	2009-11-16T00:00:00Z	pp. 569-581	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)—related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CAM1 [CEACAM1]) mediates homophilic cell adhesion and regulates signaling. Although there is evidence that CEACAM1 binds and activates SHP-1, SHP-2, and c-Src, knowledge about the mechanism of transmembrane signaling is lacking. To analyze the regulation of SHP-1/SHP-2/c-Src binding, we expressed various CFP/YFP-tagged CEACAM1 isoforms in epithelial cells. The supramolecular organization of CEACAM1 was examined by cross-linking, coclustering, coimmunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. SHP-1/SHP-2/c-Src binding was monitored by coimmunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine-induced recruitment to CEACAM1-L in cellular monolayers. We find that trans-homophilic CEACAM1 binding induces cis-dimerization by an allosteric mechanism transmitted by the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain. The balance of SHP-2 and c-Src binding is dependent on the monomer/dimer equilibrium of CEACAM1-L and is regulated by trans-binding, whereas SHP-1 does not bind under physiological conditions. CEACAM1-L homodimer formation is reduced by coexpression of CEACAM1-S and modulated by antibody ligation. These data suggest that transmembrane signaling by CEACAM1 operates by alteration of the monomer/dimer equilibrium, which leads to changes in the SHP-2/c-Src—binding ratio.

Dean	Political Psychology	27	6	2006-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 839-866	International Society of Political Psychology	fla		Previous investigations have demonstrated a relationship between endorsement of rightwing authoritarian (RWA) ideology and attitudes toward social and societal issues (e.g., abortion, drug use, affirmative action, and homosexuality). By contrast, the present studies examined the relationship between RWA and beliefs about matters of fact bearing on such issues (e.g., estimates of the prevalence of third trimester abortions, AIDS, concealed weapons). Studies 1 and 2 supported the propositions that high-RWA and low-RWA participants would show differences in their informational beliefs about sociopolitical matters consistent with differences in their respective ideologies and consistent with their putative differential cynicism about human nature. Study 3 demonstrated that the relationship between RWA and informational beliefs is amplified by the heightened salience of attitudes toward the targets of those beliefs.

Frozen tumour specimens were selected, and tissue from 72 patients (32 of whom had died) were studied. The LDL receptor content showed an inverse correlation with the survival time. Analysis by a multivariate statistical method showed that the presence of axillary metastasis, content of receptors for oestrogen and LDL, diameter of the tumour, and DNA pattern were all of prognostic value with regard to patient survival. Improved methods of predicting survival time in patients with breast cancer may be of value in the choice of treatment for individual patients.

Andrews, Offer Lieberman	Econometric Theory	21	4	2005-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 710-734	Cambridge University Press	fla		In this paper, we prove the validity of an Edgeworth expansion to the distribution of the Whittle maximum likelihood estimator for stationary long-memory Gaussian models with unknown parameter  $\theta \in \Theta \subset {\Bbb R}^{d_{\theta}}$ . The error of the (s - 2)-order expansion is shown to be o(n-(s-2)/2)--the usual independent and identically distributed rate--for a wide range of models, including the popular ARFIMA(p,d,q) models. The expansion is valid under mild assumptions on the behavior of the spectral density and its derivatives in the neighborhood of the origin. As a by-product, we generalize a theorem by Fox and Taqqu (1987, "Probability Theory and Related Fields" 74, 213-240) concerning the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices. Lieberman, Rousseau, and Zucker (2003, "Annals of Statistics" 31, 586-612) establish a valid Edgeworth expansion for the maximum likelihood estimator for stationary long-memory Gaussian models. For a significant class of models, their expansion is shown to have an error of o(n-1). The results given here improve upon those of Lieberman et al. in that the results provide an Edgeworth expansion for an asymptotically efficient estimator, as Lieberman et al. do, but the error of the expansion is shown to be o(n-(s-2)/2), not o(n-1), for a broad range of models.

Lillehoj, Sung Hyen Lee, Paul Dominowski, Robert J. Yancey, Erik P. Lillehoj	Avian Diseases	56	1	2012-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-109	American Association of Avian Pathologists	fla		This study investigated the ability of two novel adjuvant formulations, QCDC (Quil A/cholesterol/DDA/Carbopol) and QCDCR (QCDC/Bay R1005), in combination with a recombinant profilin vaccine, to modulate host protective immunity and to alter gene expression during experimental avian coccidiosis. Vaccination with profilin plus QCDCR significantly reduced the severity of intestinal lesions and increased mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation in infected chickens compared with immunization with profilin alone or profilin plus QCDC. Immunization with profilin plus QCDC or profilin plus QCDCR increased body weight gain but had no effect on fecal oocyst shedding of chickens infected with Eimeria acervulina compared with birds vaccinated with profilin alone. The results of global gene expression analysis revealed that, compared with PBS controls, (a) chickens vaccinated with profilin alone had 71 up-regulated and 56 down-regulated mRNA transcripts, (b) chickens immunized with profilin plus QCDC had 198 up-regulated and 247 down-regulated mRNAs, and (c) birds immunized with profilin plus QCDCR had 210 up-regulated and 267 down-regulated mRNAs. Compared with birds vaccinated with profilin alone, (a) chickens given profilin plus QCDC had 60 up-regulated and 104 down-regulated transcripts and (b) chickens immunized with profilin plus QCDCR had 103 up-regulated and 130 down-regulated mRNAs. Finally, chickens vaccinated with profilin plus QCDCR had 193 up-regulated and 204 down-regulated transcripts compared with birds given profilin plus QCDC. Biological function and network analysis revealed that the majority of altered transcripts were encoded by immune-related genes. Este estudio investigó la capacidad de dos nuevas formulaciones de adyuvantes, QCDC (Quil A/colesterol /DDA/Carbopol) y QCDCR (QCDC/Bay R1005), en combinación con una vacuna recombinante de profilina, para modular la inmunidad del huésped y para alterar la expresión génica durante la coccidiosis aviar experimental. La vacunación con profilina más QCDCR redujo significativamente la gravedad de las lesiones intestinales y aumentó la proliferación de linfocitos inducida por mitógenos en pollos infectados en comparación con la inmunización con profilina únicamente o con profilina más QCDC. La inmunización con profilina más QCDC o profilina más QCDCR aumentó la ganancia de peso corporal, pero no tuvo efecto sobre la eliminación de ooquistes fecales de pollos infectados con Eimeria acervulina en comparación con las aves vacunadas con profilina únicamente. Los resultados del análisis global de la expresión genética reveló que, en comparación con los controles de PBS, (a) los pollos vacunados únicamente con profilina mostraron 71 transcriptos de ARN mensajero regulados positivamente y 56 regulados de manera negativa, (b) los pollos inmunizados con profilina más QCDC mostraron 198 transcriptos de ARN mensajero regulados de manera positiva y 247 con regulación negativa, y las aves (c) inmunizadas con profilina más QCDCR mostraron 210 ARN mensajeros positivamente regulados y 267 con regulación negativa. En comparación con las aves vacunadas únicamente con profilina (a) los pollos que recibieron profilina más QCDC mostraron 60 transcripciones positivas y 104 reguladas negativamente y (b) los pollos inmunizados con profilina más QCDCR mostraron hasta 103 transcripciones de mARN positivas y 130 negativas. Finalmente, los pollos vacunados con profilina más QCDCR mostraron 193 regulaciones positivas y 204 negativas en comparación con las aves que recibieron profilina más QCDC. El análisis de la función biológica y el análisis de redes revelaron que la mayoría de las alteraciones de las transcripciones fueron codificadas por genes relacionados con la inmunidad.

Olivas	Oecologia	155	3	2008-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 593-604	International Association for Ecology, Springer	fla		The degree to which variation in plant community composition (beta-diversity) is predictable from environmental variation, relative to other spatial processes, is of considerable current interest. We addressed this question in Costa Rican rain forest pteridophytes (1,045 plots, 127 species). We also tested the effect of data quality on the results, which has largely been overlooked in earlier studies. To do so, we compared two alternative spatial models [polynomial vs. principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM)] and ten alternative environmental models (all available environmental variables vs. four subsets, and including their polynomials vs. not). Of the environmental data types, soil chemistry contributed most to explaining pteridophyte community variation, followed in decreasing order of contribution by topography, soil type and forest structure. Environmentally explained variation increased moderately when polynomials of the environmental variables were included. Spatially explained variation increased substantially when the multi-scale PCNM spatial model was used instead of the traditional, broad-scale polynomial spatial model. The best model combination (PCNM spatial model and full environmental model including polynomials) explained 32% of pteridophyte community variation, after correcting for the number of sampling sites and explanatory variables. Overall evidence for environmental control of beta-diversity was strong, and the main floristic gradients detected were correlated with environmental variation at all scales encompassed by the study (c. 100-2,000 m). Depending on model choice, however, total explained variation differed more than fourfold, and the apparent relative importance of space and environment could be reversed. Therefore, we advocate a broader recognition of the impacts that data quality has on analysis results. A general understanding of the relative contributions of spatial and environmental processes to species distributions and beta-diversity requires that methodological artefacts are separated from real ecological differences.

The results from the Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the unit root tests based on an inconsistent estimator have less size distortion and more stability of size across different autocorrelation specifications as compared to the tests based on a consistent estimator. This improvement in size property, however, comes at the cost of a loss in power. The finite-sample power, in addition to the local asymptotic power, of the tests with an inconsistent estimator is shown to be much lower than that of conventional tests. This finding can be well generalized to the test for cointegration in a multivariate system. The paper also points out that combining consistent and inconsistent estimators in the long-run variance ratio test is one possibility of balancing the size and power.

Pleck	Family Planning Perspectives	26	6	1994-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 246-251	Guttmacher Institute	fla		According to data from the 1991 National Survey of Adolescent Males, condom use is likely to be highest at the beginning of relationships and to decline as the relationship continues. The proportion of sexually active men aged 17-22 who used a condom with their most recent partner declined from 53% the first time they had intercourse with that partner to 44% at the most recent episode. Condom use also decreases with age; 59% of 17-18-year-olds used a condom the first time they had intercourse with their recent partner, compared with 56% of 19-20-year-olds and 46% of 21-22-year-olds. However, the probability that the female partner used the pill the first time that the couple had sex increased with the man's age--from 21% among 17-18-year-olds to 35% among 21-22-year-olds. Young men were more likely to have used a condom if they thought their partner was sexually inexperienced, and less likely to have done so if they suspected their partner was at high risk for an STD.

Deaths appeared to have increased in the most recent years, reaching 80 in 1983. Age at death ranged from 11 to 76 years but most deaths (72%) occurred under 20 years. Ninety five per cent of the subjects were male, and in 1983 deaths from volatile substance abuse accounted for 2% of all deaths in males aged 10-19. All areas of the United Kingdom were affected, the rates being highest in Scotland and urban areas. All social classes were affected, though rates were highest in social class V and the armed forces. The volatile substances abused were gas fuels (24%), mainly butane; aerosol sprays (17%); solvents in glues (27%); and other volatile substances, such as cleaning agents (31%). In 51% of cases death was attributed to the direct toxic effects of the substance abused, in 21% to plastic bag asphyxia, in 18% to inhalation of stomach contents, and in 11% to trauma. Deaths associated with the abuse of glues were more likely to be traumatic, but all substances appeared capable of killing directly by their toxic effects, probably by a cardiac mechanism. Only a small proportion of deaths (6%) were due to the abuse of glues among children under 16; hence current attempts to limit access of children to glues will probably have little impact on overall mortality.

Delineating how Sen's discussions of "missing women" and "gender and cooperative conflict" fit within his "capability approach" to economic and human development, the article explores how Sen's methodology employs empirical analysis toward normative ends. Those ends expand the capability of girls and women to function in all aspects of their society. It concludes with a discussion of ways to engage Sen's work within religious ethics.

This paper honours the contribution of Efraim Fischbein, who died in July 1998, to these endeavours. The first section summarises Fischbein's early work, culminating in his 1975 book 'The Intuitive Sources of Probabilistic Thinking in Children'. The second focusses on three major themes prominent in that book, and elaborated in later work by Fischbein and his colleagues, namely: (a) The role of intuition in mathematical and scientific thinking, (b) The development of probabilistic thinking, and (c) The influence of instruction on that development. In the final section, suggestions are made as to how Fischbein's pioneering work can be built upon, in particular for improving the teaching of probability in schools.

Metribuzin PRE controlled sicklepod and pitted morningglory more consistently than other treatments. At 9 wk after planting, antagonism occurred in most cases on sicklepod control when metribuzin was tank-mixed with a non-selective herbicide. Other selective herbicides required addition of a non-selective herbicide at planting to effectively control sicklepod and pitted morningglory. Sicklepod and pitted morningglory control was better with POST selective herbicides when following glufosinate or paraquat than when following glyphosate or SC-0224. In most instances a follow-up POST treatment was needed to maintain weed control from non-selective herbicides applied PRE. Metribuzin and metribuzin plus chlorimuron increased soybean yields when tank-mixed with paraquat compared with yields obtained with paraquat alone.

Male coyotes from northeastern North America (16.4 ± 1.5 [SD] kg, range = 14.2-20.4) were heavier than females from the northeast (14.7 ± 1.6 kg, range = 11.9-17.9) and were also heavier than male (10.6 ± 1.0 kg, range = 8.8-12.0) and female coyotes (12.1 ± 1.1 kg, range = 10.5-14.1) from outside of the northeast. Female coyotes from northeastern North America were heavier than all male and female western coyotes. Longitude was significantly correlated in both male (r = -0.786, P < 0.0001) and female (r = -0.769, P < 0.0001) body mass, whereas there was less of a correlation for latitude and body mass for males (r = 0.355, P = 0.043) and females (r = 0.364, P = 0.044). Sixty-two percent (P < 0.0001) and 59% (P < 0.0001) of variation in body mass of males and females, respectively, could be explained by longitude, while 13% (P = 0.043 for males; P = 0.044 for females) could be accounted for by latitude.

The study discloses that the most efficient solution procedure arises by coupling a primal transportation algorithm (embodying recently developed methods for accelerating the determination of basis trees and dual evaluators) with a version of the Row Minimum start rule and a "modified row first negative evaluator" rule. The resulting method has been found to be at least 100 times faster than OPHELIE, and 9 times faster than a streamlined version of the SHARE out-of-kilter code. The method's median solution time for solving 1000 x 1000 transportation problems on a CDC 6600 computer is 17 seconds with a range of 14 to 22 seconds. Some of the unique characteristics of this study are (1) all of the fundamental solution techniques are tested on the same machine and the same problems, (2) a broad spectrum of problem sizes are examined, varying from 10 x 10 to 1000 x 1000; (3) a broad profile of nondense problems are examined ranging from 100 percent to 1 percent dense; and (4) additional tests using the best of the codes have been made on three other machines (IBM 360/65, UNIVAC 1108, and CDC 6400), providing surprising insights into conclusions based on comparing times on different machines and compilers.

Chiesa	Journal of Crustacean Biology	25	4	2005-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 577-584	The Crustacean Society	fla		The relationship between rhythms of circadian periodicity (i.e., from 20 to 28 h) and ultradian periodicity (i.e., less than 20 h) was studied in the burrowing decapod Nephrops norvegicus at the level of its cardiac activity. Animals were kept over a month under constant darkness (DD) interrupted by a few days of light-darkness regime (LD) at the beginning of the experiment. Time series (beats per 10 min) were subdivided into stages of similar numbers of days. A general mean waveform was computed per stage by averaging 24 h segments of different time series per corresponding 10 min intervals. Marked fluctuations were observed at the beginning of tests in DD, being disrupted during animals' exposure to LD. Fluctuations progressively recovered over following stages of DD. The activity part of a rhythm (α) was computed in mean waveforms of different time series per each stage. Resulting values were averaged at corresponding stages. A significant increment of mean α was observed from DD to LD, decreasing over the following prolonged DD exposure. Periodogram analysis was used to assess periodicities of time series at each stage. Fourier analysis was undertaken to assess the transformation of cardiac rhythms over consecutive stages not only in terms of periodicity but also as amplitude. Both analyses showed the presence of different circadian and ultradian (i.e., 12 h and 18 h) rhythms varying in their amplitude at different stages of testing. A preponderance of time series with ultradian periodicities took place in the first stage of DD. Under LD, the number of time series showing 18 h periodicity increased, but their amplitude of fluctuation was lower compared to the previous stage. In contrast, the circadian periodicity present in the first stage of DD disappeared in LD, to be restored over prolonged DD exposure. Present results suggest that a disruption of the circadian rhythm in cardiac activity generated ultradian periods when controlling oscillators became uncoupled. Results are discussed in the context of the ecology of the species, and a model based on the phase decoupling of circadian oscillators is presented to account for the generation of ultradian 12 h and 18 h periodicities.

Ridgeway	American Sociological Review	62	2	1997-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 218-235	American Sociological Association	fla		How can we explain the persistence of gender hierarchy over transformations in its socioeconomic base? Part of the answer lies in the mediation of gender inequality by taken-for-granted interactional processes that rewrite inequality into new institutional arrangements. The problems of interacting cause actors to automatically sex-categorize others and, thus, to cue gender stereotypes that have various effects on interactional outcomes, usually by modifying the performance of other, more salient identities. Because changes in the status dimension of gender stereotypes lag behind changes in resource inequalities, interactional status processes can reestablish gender inequalities in new structural forms. Interactional sex categorization also biases the choice of comparison others, causing men and women to judge differently the rewards available to them. Operating in workplace relations, these processes conserve inequality by driving the gender-labeling of jobs, constructing people as gender-interested actors, contributing to employers' discriminatory preferences, and mediating men's and women's perceptions of alternatives and their willingness to settle for given job outcomes.

Borras, Jr.	Review of International Political Economy	14	1	2007-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 143-175	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		The 'free market', export-led development strategy has not delivered its promise of development in agriculture, as far as the Philippines is concerned. The World Bank- and IMF-instigated privatization and deregulation policies with direct consequence to rural livelihoods carried out much earlier and far wider in the Philippines than in some other Southeast Asian countries have coincided, overlapped and interlinked with the GATT/WTO trade/exchange rules. These two broad sets of policy related to agricultural production and exchange, combined, have largely reinforced, not undermined or eroded, pre-existing agrarian structures dominated by domestic and transnational elites. The overall outcome is the opposite of neoliberal reformers' predictions: the transformation of the Philippines from a net agricultural exporting to a net agricultural importing country. This development strategy has failed to address the persistence of poverty and growing inequality in this country. If a poverty-eradicating strategic national development is to be achieved in the Philippines and in some of the latter's regional neighbors, a radical recasting of the pre-existing agrarian structures partly through explicitly pro-poor land policies will be necessary and urgent.

Cela a pour conséquences que les nombreux postes vacants dans le marché du travail canadien constituent une borne supérieure lorsque l'on parle de "chômage structurel". Cet article donne un résumé des estimés disponibles sur le taux de postes vacants au Canada. Dans le secteur des hautes technologies, ce taux peut être équivalent à 2.2 pour cent de la force de travail mais l'évidence provenant de sondages plus représentatifs révèle que ce taux se situe entre 0.45 et 0.75 pour cent pour l'économie dans sa totalité. Malgré une tendance à la hausse dans la relation entre l'indice d'offre d'emploi et le taux de chômage, tendance qui a suscitée des inquiétudes durant les années 80, on note un renversement de la tendance dans les années 90. /// This paper starts from the definition that "structural unemployment occurs when workers are unable to fill available jobs because they lack the skills, do not live where jobs are available, or are unwilling to work at the wage rate offered in the market." This implies that the number of vacancies in the Canadian labour market is an upper bound to the extent of "structural unemployment." The paper summarizes available estimates of the vacancy rate in Canada. In the high technology sector, vacancies may be equivalent to 2.2 percent of the labour force but evidence from more representative surveys indicates a range of 0.45 to 0.75 percent for the economy as a whole. Although during the 1980s the outward shift in the relationship between the Help-Wanted Index and the unemployment rate raised concerns that structural unemployment was an increasing problem in Canada, that shift has been reversed in the 1990s.

Webster	Journal of the North American Benthological Society	8	1	1989-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 74-84	Society for Freshwater Science	fla		Chemical composition and microbial activity of seston (i.e., fine particulate organic matter and associated inorganic material in transport) in a southern Appalachian headwater stream were evaluated to determine whether changes in microbial activity associated with decreasing particle size were related to changes in seston surface area and/or chemical composition. As seston particle size decreased from 500 to 10 μm, organic content measured as ash free dry mass decreased from 72.5% to 36.7%. Simultaneously, the nutritional quality of the organic fraction declined, as evidenced by increases in lignin and cellulose content and corresponding reductions in acid-detergent-soluble materials (simple carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). Microbial activity, measured as mass-specific <sup>14</sup>C-glucose mineralization and <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation rates, increased significantly as particle size decreased, despite the reduced nutritional quality of smaller particles. Microbial biomass (ATP) and activity (glucose mineralization) per unit seston surface area were proportional to particle size over the 10-250-μm particle size range. Smaller particles of lower nutritional quality supported lower area-specific microbial biomass and activity. Production: biomass ratios of microorganisms associated with seston were low (1.21 to 6.08 × 10<sup>-9</sup>/hr), suggesting that these microorganisms may have become inactive in response to the gradual decline in quality of detritus as it decomposed.

This article examines the performance and risk sensitivities of US green mutual funds vis-à-vis their conventional peers. We also analyze and compare this performance relative to other socially responsible investing (SRI) mutual funds. In order to implement this analysis, we apply a CAPM-based methodology and find that in the 1987-2009 period, environmental funds had lower performance than conventional funds with similar characteristics. However, if we focus on a more recent period (2001-2009), green funds achieved adjusted returns not significantly different from the rest of SRI and conventional mutual funds.

Survey findings from Florida, Tennessee, and Texas show that MC and FFS enrollees do not differ substantially on most access and satisfaction measures, with a few notable exceptions. When compared with their FFS counterparts, African-American MC enrollees are twice as likely to report problems in obtaining needed care, and Hispanic MC enrollees are nearly twice as likely to rate the extent to which their providers care about them as "fair" or "poor." In contrast, whites in MC are less likely to be without a regular provider than their FFS counterparts, but report greater dissatisfaction with the extent to which providers care about them.

This trend was found to be most pronounced among women greater than 24 yeas old, and among multiparous women, and to be negatively correlated with seasonal variations in temperature and daylight. The phenomenon is likely multifactorial in origin, with sociocultural factors playing a considerable role. The influence of increasing maternal age and parity in the expression of the seasonal trend may be a function of age-related changes in families, with nuclear families acting as the most powerful potentiators of seasonality.

Brook	Journal of Tropical Ecology	27	2	2011-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 171-180	Cambridge University Press	fla		We describe the spatial aggregation of the magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata) in relation to the dynamics of the ephemeral floodplains of northern Australia. Past broad-scale studies have linked geese to floodplains dominated by the sedge, Eleocharis dulcis, but the type of response has not been determined, nor the impact of predation on food plants. Moreover, departure thresholds are not known. We develop hypotheses on aggregation and departure and confront these with field data. Thus, from 2005–2007 we established two sites on the floodplains of Kakadu National Park (three 1-ha plots per site, six plots in total) and used for monthly, dry season bird counts. An airboat was used to collect data from each of the six plots, including sedge tubers and measures of water level and soil viscosity. Further, we built exclosures (three per site, six in total) to test the impact of herbivory on E. dulcis. Generalized linear models and information theory were used to test the strength of supporting evidence for alternate hypotheses. Geese showed a clear aggregative response to E. dulcis tubers, were forced to depart following floodplain drying and had a marked impact on E. dulcis tuber density. Despite this, there was no evidence of a negative-feedback mechanism between plant—herbivore populations, suggesting that the system is driven by extrinsic parameters (here rainfall).

We create panel data on consumption for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics using an imputation procedure based on food demand estimates from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We document a disjuncture between income and consumption inequality over the 1980s and show that it can be explained by changes in the persistence of income shocks. We find some partial insurance of permanent shocks, especially for the college educated and those near retirement. We find full insurance of transitory shocks except among poor households. Taxes, transfers, and family labor supply play an important role in insuring permanent shocks.

Alwin	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 30-46	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper addresses a number of theoretical and empirical issues derived from distributive justice theory regarding the social psychological process of justice evaluation. Building upon current theory and research, justice evaluation is conceived as a comparison of the rewards one receives with rewards s/he expects. Using data from a 1979 Indianapolis area survey, we examine beliefs about inequality and their role in subjective perceptions of distributive justice. We examine the extent to which "what is" affects perceptions of "what ought to be" using collective beliefs about distribution practices, that is, the extent to which persons perceive departures from justice in terms of existential standards. We find that it is possible to abstract, with a high degree of distinctiveness, a set of aggregate principles representing existential notions about the ways in which individual characteristics are related to household income. We find that this approach to the measurement of reference standards for the evaluation of income receipts has some empirical validity, in that it predicts perceptions of over- vs. under-reward, but such an approach to measuring departures from justice does not produce meaningful variation in measures of satisfaction and acceptance of income.

Neufeld, Cassidy Rankine	Invertebrate Biology	131	2	2012-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 96-109	American Microscopical Society, Wiley	fla		Many aspects of barnacle body form are known to be developmentally plastic. Perhaps the most striking examples of such plasticity occur in their feeding legs and unusually long penises, the sizes and shapes of which can change dramatically and adaptively with changes in conspecific density and local water flow conditions. However, whether variation in overall appendage form is mirrored by structural responses in cuticle and muscle is not known. In order to determine how structural variation underlies phenotypic plasticity in barnacle appendages, we examined barnacles occurring at low and high population densities from one wave-protected and one wave-exposed site. We used histological sectioning and fluorescence microscopy of feeding legs and penises to compare cuticle thickness, muscle thickness, and muscle organization, and artificial penis inflation to compare penis extensibility. We observed striking differences in cuticle thickness, muscle thickness, and muscle organization between sites that differed in water velocity, but we found no clear differences associated with variation in conspecific density. Penis extensibility also did not differ consistently between sites. These results are consistent with an adaptive explanation for much of the remarkable and complex variation in barnacle feeding leg and penis morphology among sites that differ in water velocity.

It is shown here that a representative schedule is very closely approximated by a simple closed form frequency function, which is the limiting distribution of the convolution of an infinite number of exponentially distributed components. The schedule is approximated equally well by the convolution of a normal distribution (of age of entry into a marriageable state) and as few as three exponentially distributed delays. The latter convolution provides a plausible model of nuptiality, a model that receives surprising empirical support.

Taylor	Plant Physiology	154	2	2010-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 656-664	American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)	fla		The factors that regulate storage organ carotenoid content remain to be fully elucidated, despite the nutritional and economic importance of this class of compound. Recent findings suggest that carotenoid pool size is determined, at least in part, by the activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase4 (CCD4) activity affects potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber carotenoid content. Microarray analysis revealed elevated expression of the potato CCD4 gene in mature tubers from white-fleshed cultivars compared with higher carotenoid yellow-fleshed tubers. The expression level of the potato CCD4 gene was down-regulated using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach in stable transgenic lines. Down-regulation in tubers resulted in an increased carotenoid content, 2- to 5-fold higher than in control plants. The increase in carotenoid content was mainly due to elevated violaxanthin content, implying that this carotenoid may act as the in vivo substrate. Although transcript level was also reduced in plant organs other than tubers, such as leaves, stems, and roots, there was no change in carotenoid content in these organs. However, carotenoid levels were elevated in flower petals from RNAi lines. As well as changes in tuber carotenoid content, tubers from RNAi lines exhibited phenotypes such as heat sprouting, formation of chain tubers, and an elongated shape. These results suggest that the product of the CCD4 reaction may be an important factor in tuber heat responses.

The purpose of this form of analysis is to help model interactions in which the parties involved may have quite different perceptions of the "game" being played. Soccer hooliganism is considered in terms of an interaction between two main parties-the "hooligan fans" and the "authorities". Recent empirical studies are used to help build up representations of some possible "games" that may be seen by each side. From the resulting hypergames, predictions are derived as to the likely outcome under various circumstances. Also considered are possible effects of taking the interaction through several "rounds". Finally, some practical conclusions are drawn, both about the problem of how best to respond to soccer hooliganism, and about the methodological question of how to approach the analysis of such social conflicts in a systematic way.

But this does not entirely explain the suicides; one has here to understand the social milieu in which an individual gets alienated from the family and the society.

Smith	Proceedings: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences	466	2118	2010-06-08T00:00:00Z	pp. 1725-1748	The Royal Society	fla		We describe a boundary-element method used to model the hydrodynamics of a bacterium propelled by a single helical flagellum. Using this model, we optimize the power efficiency of swimming with respect to cell body and flagellum geometrical parameters, and find that optima for swimming in unbounded fluid and near a no-slip plane boundary are nearly indistinguishable. We also consider the novel optimization objective of torque efficiency and find a very different optimal shape. Excluding effects such as Brownian motion and electrostatic interactions, it is demonstrated that hydrodynamic forces may trap the bacterium in a stable, circular orbit near the boundary, leading to the empirically observable surface accumulation of bacteria. Furthermore, the details and even the existence of this stable orbit depend on geometrical parameters of the bacterium, as described in this article. These results shed some light on the phenomenon of surface accumulation of micro-organisms and offer hydrodynamic explanations as to why some bacteria may accumulate more readily than others based on morphology.

After examining some of the popular explanations for the "missed call," this paper shows that while the voters "preferred" Thompson, there was a very substantial increase in the number of straigh party ballots cast for the Democrats, compared to 1978. This paper concludes that in those states where straight party vote is an option, the poll takers probe for the possibility of a party line vote. Information used in this paper to examine five hypotheses stems from a preelection poll of 1,200 Illinois voters.

According to organizational learning research, firms position themselves in a unidimensional search space that spans a spectrum from local to distant search. Our findings in the global robotics industry suggest that firms' search efforts actually vary across two distinct dimensions: search depth, or how frequently the firm reuses its existing knowledge, and search scope, or how widely the firm explores new knowledge.

In all the sciences the forces and phenomena are infinite in number, complicated, elusive, diverse. The method is alike in all: the workers create causes to explain observed events. There must be abstraction with the assumption that certain axioms are true unproved and that certain factors do not vary or else are negligible in effect. In physics and biology, however, the workers have shown more tendency to agree upon the use of hypotheses, axioms, specific methods, classification, mathematics, and logic than have workers in the social sciences. The scientific worker is always himself part and parcel of the material with which he works. Objectivity, exactitude, and certitude are always but very relatively attained.

Harper	Environmental Health Perspectives	114	5	2006-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 697-703	Brogan & Partners	fla		Several adverse health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity, have been linked to exposure to particulate matter in ambient air; however, the biologic activity of gas-phase ambient organic air contaminants has not been examined as thoroughly. Using aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-based and estrogen receptor (ER)-based cell bioassay systems, we assessed the dioxin-like and estrogenic activities of gas-phase organic ambient air contaminants compared with those of particulate-phase contaminants using samples collected between seasons over 2 years from an urban and a rural location in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. The concentration of the sum (Σ) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which was highest in the gas phase, was 10-100 times more abundant than that of <tex-math>$\Sigma polychlorinated$</tex-math> biphenyls, <tex-math>$\Sigma nitro$</tex-math>-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and <tex-math>$\Sigma organochlorine$</tex-math> pesticides, and 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> times more abundant than <tex-math>$\Sigma polychlorinated$</tex-math> dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans. Gas-phase samples induced significant AHR- and ER-dependent gene expression. The activity of the gas-phase samples was greater than that of the particulatephase samples in the estrogen assay and, in one case, in the AHR assay. We found no strong associations between either summer or winter seasons or urban or rural locations in the relative efficacy of the extracts in either the ER or AHR assay despite differences in chemical composition, concentrations, and abundance. Our results suggest that mechanistic studies of the health effects of ambient air must consider gas and particulate phases because chemicals present in both phases can affect AHR and ER signaling pathways.

Smokowski	Social Service Review	72	3	1998-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 337-364	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article addresses the emergence of a resilience‐based prevention practice perspective that focuses on positively affecting the development of disadvantaged, at‐risk children. Significant progress has been made in understanding risk and resilience processes; however, use of the field's advances in applied settings has lagged. The article will attempt to bridge this gap by reviewing relevant issues in program design, implementation, and evaluation from a resilience perspective. Risk and resilience dynamics are briefly highlighted to illuminate theoretical routes for promoting positive adaptation. Trends in constructing preventive programs are underscored, focusing on ecological routes to behavioral and environmental change. Finally, prevention and early intervention programs for disadvantaged children ages 3–9 illustrate issues in program conception and effectiveness. Methodological concerns in evaluation of these programs are discussed, and future recommendations are given.

Investigating the role of local churches in empowering citizens, the study found that the local Catholic church was more effectively fostering a nascent sense of political efficacy among women than were local Presbyterian churches. Explaining this finding, the article presents two issues that expose problems in the liberal understanding of civil society, and underscore important themes raised in the critical discourse. First, the study reveals that organisations characterised by decentralised authority structures and internal democracy may fail to contribute to the empowerment of marginalised citizens. Such organisations are prone to reproduce and exacerbate local inequalities and conflicts within their structures. Second, corroborating critical views, the study highlights the importance of recognising how power relations affect the character and operation of civil society organisations. The adjusting of power relations within organisations may be a prerequisite to their serving an empowering role with marginalised citizens.

Stenseth, Jakob Gjøsæter	Ecology	83	6	2002-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1676-1688	Ecological Society of America	fla		Individual growth and size distributions within populations are generally influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Positively skewed size distributions may arise as a result of any size-selective process, such as food scarcity or competition. While such patterns have been observed for a variety of terrestrial plant and animal species, size distribution has been less studied for marine fish in the natural environment. This we do in the present paper. In order to investigate the effect of density and environment on juvenile coastal cod (Gadus morhua L.), we assess the length distributions of fish caught at fixed locations along the southern Norwegian Skagerrak coast over the period 1919-1996. We demonstrate that most distributions are skewed to the right, suggesting that competition may influence these systems; such effects seem to be strongest for sheltered stations inside the fjords. Density dependence is inferred as skewness increases with increased density, and the average length decreases with increased density. The skewness, average length, and abundance of juvenile cod caught in the autumn are shown to be influenced by the meteorological conditions in the spring (i.e., during the larval period). Directional wind stress along the shore and toward the shore and high temperatures create favorable conditions for the development of cod larvae. The effects of local abiotic factors may be measured through the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index, a large-scale climatic proxy.

Volume and isolation level of stream sections of 150 m were estimated; tadpoles, adult anurans, and potential tadpole predators were searched for over 16 consecutive months. Stream size, isolation, richness and diversity of tadpole predators, and some additional physical and biotic variables were measured and related to anuran species richness. Smaller streams tended to shelter more anuran species than larger ones, but neither stream size nor stream isolation explained variations in anuran species richness. Anuran species richness tended to increase with tadpole predator diversity. Tadpole species richness was influenced by predator species richness, and was highest when there were seven types of tadpole predators present. The distribution of few anuran species could be clearly related to particular physical and biotic variables. The behavioural flexibility of anurans and the similarity among streams may have contributed to this pattern.

Bowen	Ecological Applications	17	2	2007-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 620-627	Ecological Society of America	fla		We investigated movements of female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) roosting in maternity colonies in buildings in Fort Collins, Colorado (USA), during the summers of 2002, 2003, and 2005. This behavior can be of public health concern where bats that may carry diseases (e.g., rabies) move among buildings occupied by people. We used passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) to mark individual bats and hoop PIT readers at emergence points to passively monitor the use of building roosts by marked adult females on a daily basis during the lactation phase of reproduction. Multi-strata models were used to examine movements among roosts in relation to ambient temperatures and ectoparasite loads. Our results suggest that high ambient temperatures influence movements. Numbers of mites (Steatonyssus occidentalis) did not appear to influence movements of female bats among building roosts. In an urban landscape, periods with unusually hot conditions are accompanied by shifting of bats to different buildings or segments of buildings, and this behavior may increase the potential for contact with people in settings where, in comparison to their more regularly used buildings, the bats may be more likely to be of public concern as nuisances or health risks.

A commonly encountered complication in the analysis of such data is the variable length of follow-up due to right censorship. This can be further exacerbated by the possible dependency between the censoring time and the longitudinal measurements. This article proposes a combination of a semiparametric transformation model for the censoring time and a linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal measurements. The dependency is handled via latent variables which are naturally incorporated. We show that the likelihood function has an explicit form and develops a two-stage estimation procedure to avoid direct maximization over a high-dimensional parameter space. The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, with a closed form for the variance-covariance matrix that can be used to obtain a plug-in estimator. Finite sample performance of the proposed approach is assessed through extensive simulations. The method is applied to renal disease data. /// On parle de données longitudinales quand les sujets sont suivis sur une période de temps. Une complication fréquemment rencontrée dans l'analyse de telles données est la variable durée de suivie due aux censures à droite. Ceci peut être amplifé par la possible dépendance entre le temps de censure et les mesures longitudinales. Cet article propose l'association d'un modèle de transformation semi-paramétrique pour les temps de censure et d'un modèle linéaire à effets mixtes pour les mesures longitudinales. La dépendance est prise en compte via des variables latentes qui sont évidemment intégrées. Nous montrons que la fonction de vraisemblance a une forme explicite et nous développons une procédure d'estimation à deux étapes pour éviter une maximisation directe sur un espace de paramètre à grande dimension. Les estimateurs obtenus sont consistants et asymptotiquement normaux, avec une matrice de variance-covariance qui peut etre utilisée pour obtenir un estimateur ≪plug-in≫. Les propriétés de la méthode proposée sont étudiées par de nombreuses simulations. La méthode est appliquée aux données de maladie rénale.

Johnson, Basil J. Nikolau, Eve Syrkin Wurtele	Plant Physiology	115	4	1997-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1371-1383	American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)	fla		The biotin carboxylase subunit of the heteromeric chloroplastic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) of Arabidopsis thaliana is coded by a single gene (CAC2), which is interrupted by 15 introns. The cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 537 amino acids with an apparent N-terminal chloroplast-targeting transit peptide. Antibodies generated to a glutathione S-transferase-CAC2 fusion protein react solely with a 51-kD polypeptide of Arabidopsis; these antibodies also inhibit ACCase activity in extracts of Arabidopsis. The entire CAC2 cDNA sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting recombinant biotin carboxylase was enzymatically active in carboxylating free biotin. The catalytic properties of the recombinant biotin carboxylase indicate that the activity of the heteromeric ACCase may be regulated by light-/dark-induced changes in stromal pH. The CAC2 gene is maximally expressed in organs and tissues that are actively synthesizing fatty acids for membrane lipids or oil deposition. The observed expression pattern of CAC2 mirrors that previously reported for the CAC1 gene (J.-K. Choi, F. Yu, E. S. Wurtele, B. J. Nikolau [1995] Plant Physiol 109: 619-625; J. Ke, J. -K. Choi, M. Smith, H. T. Horner, B. J. Nikolau, E. S. Wurtele [1997] Plant Physiol 113: 357-365), which codes for the biotin carboxyl carrier subunit of the heteromeric ACCase. This coordination is probably partially established by coordinate transcription of the two genes. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that the CAC2 and CAC1 gene promoters share a common set of sequence motifs that may be important in guiding the transcription of these genes.

This study took place over a 2 year period and utilized an experimental crossover design which consisted of two separate trials of laboratory investigation. Assessment data and attitudinal data were gathered and analyzed to measure the instructional value of physical and virtual lab experiences in terms of student performance and attitudes. Test statistics were conducted for differences of means for assessment data. Student attitudes towards virtual experiences in comparison to physical lab experiences were measured using a newly created Virtual and Physical Experimentation Questionnaire (VPEQ). VPEQ was specifically developed for this study, and included new scales of Usefulness of Lab, and Equipment Usability which measured attitudinal dimensions in virtual and physical lab experiences. A factor analysis was conducted for questionnaire data, and reliability of the scales and internal consistency of items within scales were calculated. The new scales were statistically valid and reliable. The instructional value of physical and virtual lab experiences was comparable in terms of student performance. Students showed preference towards the virtual medium in their lab experiences. Students showed positive attitudes towards physical and virtual experiences, and demonstrated a preference towards inquiry-based experiences, physical or virtual. Students found virtual experiences to have higher equipment usability as well as a higher degree of openendedness. In regards to student access to inquiry-based lab experiences, virtual and online alternatives were viewed favorably by students.

This theory has recently received empirical support from Edwards (1977) and Hannan and Mavinga (1980). In this article, it is shown that for expense-preference behavior to exist, the effectiveness of the technology for conflict control between shareholders and managers must be related to market structure, which is a tenuous proposition. Further, once differences in monitoring costs due to variation in firm size are controlled for, the empirical evidence supports managerial profit-maximizing rather than expense-preference behavior.

We examined whether the source of funding of studies of the effects of low-level radiofrequency radiation is associated with the results of studies. We conducted a systematic review of studies of controlled exposure to radiofrequency radiation with health-related outcomes (electroencephalogram, cognitive or cardiovascular function, hormone levels, symptoms, and subjective well-being). Data sources: We searched EMBASE, Medline, and a specialist database in February 2005 and scrutinized reference lists from relevant publications. Data extraction: Data on the source of funding, study design, methodologic quality, and other study characteristics were extracted. The primary outcome was the reporting of at least one statistically significant association between the exposure and a health-related outcome. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. Data synthesis: Of 59 studies, 12 (20%) were funded exclusively by the telecommunications industry, 11 (19%) were funded by public agencies or charities, 14 (24%) had mixed funding (including industry), and in 22 (37%) the source of funding was not reported. Studies funded exclusively by industry reported the largest number of outcomes, but were least likely to report a statistically significant result: The odds ratio was 0.11 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.78), compared with studies funded by public agencies or charities. This finding was not materially altered in analyses adjusted for the number of outcomes reported, study quality, and other factors. Conclusions: The interpretation of results from studies of health effects of radiofrequency radiation should take sponsorship into account.

For if it were not transitive, we would be precluded from accepting the truisms that if two things look the same then the way they look is the same and that if two things look the same then if one looks red, so does the other. Nevertheless, it has seemed obvious to many philosophers (e.g. Goodman, Armstrong and Dummett) that phenomenal indiscriminability is not transitive; and, moreover, that this non-transitivity is straightforwardly revealed to us in experience. I show this thought to be wrong. All inferences from the character of our experience to the non-transitivity of indiscriminability involve either a misunderstanding of continuity, a mistaken interpretation of the idea that we have limited powers of discrimination, or tendentious claims about what our experience is really like; or such inferences are based on inadequately supported premisses, which though individually plausible are jointly implausible.

Gilbert	The Academy of Management Journal	48	5	2005-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 741-763	Academy of Management	fla		I work to unbundle the structure of inertia into two distinct categories: resource rigidity (failure to change resource investment patterns) and routine rigidity (failure to change organizational processes that use those resources). Given discontinuous change, a researcher's failure to recognize these distinctions can generate conflicting findings regarding effects of threat perception on inertia. Using field data on the response of newspaper organizations to the rise of digital media, I show that a strong perception of threat helps overcome resource rigidity but simultaneously amplifies routine rigidity. I develop an interpretive model exploring mechanisms for overcoming these divergent behaviors.

L'auteur propose une conceptualisation et une typologie nouvelles des méthodes de simulation applicables à l'analyse macroéconomique. Trois types de simulation sont définis: - La simulation des résultats se présente comme l'interprétation numérique, réalisée sur ordinateur, d'un modèle économique. - La simulation informaticielle se définit sommairement comme l'union de l'informatique, de l'économétrie, de l'analyse numérique, et de " quelque chose de plus "; ce " quelque chose de plus " se trouve aux confins de la méthodologie (analyse dynamique, validation des modèles, automatisation des expériences), mais pour des simulations plus évoluées, la formation économétrique perd de son importance au profit de la programmation et de l'organigramme logique. - La simulation semi-informaticielle se différencie de la précédente par l'objectif pédagogique qui l'anime, par la réduction de l'importance accordée à la validation des modèles et par la nécessité de décisions à chaque étape du processus de la simulation. L'auteur s'efforce alors de montrer combien cette conceptualisation peut aisément s'appliquer à quelques simulations macroéconomiques très connues (Klein-Goldberger, Fifi, O.B.E., Holland Gillespie, Paelinck - de Biolley, Broockings Institution...). /// The word " simulation " has lost its conceptual strictness. The author proposes both new conceptualization and typology of simulation methods applied to macroeconomic analysis. Three types of simulation are defined: - " Simulation of results " is a numerical interpretation of an economic model, realized on a computer. - " Computer simulation " is briefly defined as union of computer, econometrics, numerical analysis and " something more "; this " something more " is located at the limit of the methodology (dynamic analysis, validation of models, automatization of experiments); but, for more sophisticated simulation, the econometric formalization loses its importance as compared to programmation and flow chart. - " Quasi-computer simulation " differs from the former by its pedagogical aim, the reduced importance given to the validation of the model and by the obligation of decision at each step of the process of simulation. The author tries then to show how these conceptualization can easily be applied to some well-known macroeconomic simulation models (Klein-Goldberger, Fifi, O.B.E., Holland-Gillespie, Paelinck - de Biolley, Broockings Institution...).

Coyle, Kimberly J. Van Zee, John P. Pribble, David M. Stiles, Philip S. Barie, Wim A. Buurman, Lyle L. Moldawer, Stephen F. Lowry	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	172	2	1995-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 577-580	Oxford University Press	fla		Studies were done in baboons and humans to assess the role of interleukin (IL)-l on the release of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs) during sepsis. In baboons, IL-1α induced increased levels of sTNFR types I and II. Infusion of Escherichia coli into baboons also led to higher sTNFR levels. Treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra) attenuated the rise in sTNFR-1, which was positively correlated with a partial preservation of renal function by IL-1ra. In patients with sepsis, treatment with IL-1ra also was associated with lower levels of sTNFR-I but did not influence plasma creatinine levels. IL-1ra did not affect sTNFR-II in baboons or humans. These data suggest that IL-1 produced during sepsis is involved in increases in sTNFR-I. Such increases during rapidly fatal septic shock may in part be explained by an effect on the renal clearance of sTNFR-I.

Seitsinger	The Journal of Educational Research	99	1	2005-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 19-30	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		National curriculum standards call for meaningful teaching and learning that are developmentally appropriate and that help all students reach proficiency not only in basic skills but also in higher order thinking skills and real-world application of skills. Service-learning (SL) is among recommendations from educators for including real-world experiences into students' education. The paucity of research and mixed findings on academic outcomes from K-12 SL led the author to examine opportunity-to-learn conditions and practices of 2,164 teachers in 271 middle schools involved in school improvement. The author analyzed teacher reports to determine (a) attitudes and beliefs toward SL; (b) extent to which teachers implemented SL; and (c) relationships between teachers' attitudes and beliefs, SL, and standards-based instructional practices. Although teachers believed that SL was essential for effective education, most teachers used SL infrequently. One-way multivariate analysis of variance revealed that teachers who implemented SL regularly used standards-based instructional practices more often than did their colleagues. Implications for preservice and inservice teachers are discussed.

This article uses a model to assess the pure risk premium for corporate bond insurance where both nonzero correlation between frequency and severity and nonzero correlation between individual risk units are allowed. The results suggest that corporate bond risk insurance could be offered by a third party insurer at a lower cost than the prevailing market default risk premium.

Among 871 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and 439 high-risk HIV-uninfected women, seroprevalences of cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and prevalence of human papillomavirus DNA in cervicovaginal lavage fluids were all >50% and were 2-30 times higher than prevalences in the general population. Prevalences were highest among HIV-infected women, of whom 44.2% had ≥5 other infections, and were relatively high even among the youngest women (age 16-25 years). In multivariate analyses, viral infections were independently associated not only with behaviors such as injection drug use and commercial sex but also with low income, low levels of education, and black race. Disadvantaged women and women who engage in high-risk behaviors are more likely to be coinfected with HIV and other viruses and, thus, may be at high risk of serious disease sequelae.

Maritime labour was characterised by a series of hiring practices and business dynamics which make it particularly worthy of attention. The impact of steam and steel technology, increased capitalization and government attention, and the emergence of a collective identity within the workforce, combine to produce a unique but important labour phenomenon which the existence of almost complete demographic and employment data bring well within the grasp of the historian. Various methodologies for studying the material are discussed, and the preferred method of studying the workforce of one large firm over a short period of time is illustrated with a brief case study. /// L'intéret historique que présente l'histoire maritime britannique aux 19e et 20e siècles justifie amplement l'attention systématique portée par les historiens à la collection de listes d'équipage des Archives historiques maritimes de l'université Memorial de Terre-Neuve.

Blaylock	Western Journal of Agricultural Economics	10	1	1985-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 41-54	Western Agricultural Economics Association	fla		A two equation model is developed to examine jointly the determinants of household food stamp program participation and program effects on food expenditures. The model is unique in that it postulates that the participation decision is based on a cost-benefit ratio, selected socioeconomic characteristics, and the potential for increasing both food and nonfood expenditures. Data from the 1977-78 USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Survey Supplemental Low Income Sample is used to estimate the model. Findings suggest that households, in making the participation decision, place equal value on the potential for increasing their food and nonfood expenditures. However, at the margin, bonus stamp income is found to have more than twice the impact of money income on food expenditures. The model's potential for policy analysis is also examined.

A government indicator of a secondary school's performance in England and Wales is the students' success in examinations. The examination results of over 3000 OFSTED inspected secondary schools offering students for General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examination during the 1992 to 1997 inspection cycle were modelled statistically. For kinds of schools where achievement was already much higher or lower than the average (e.g. selective schools), inspection was associated with slight improvements in achievement. For county, local education authority maintained, comprehensive schools (the largest single group), inspection did not improve examination achievement. Some implications for school improvement are discussed.

This paper reexamines the concept of prisonization and provides an empirical test of the process Clemmer described. Because of Clemmer's concern with the process of induction, little attention has been paid to changes inmates may exhibit as they approach the time of release. Evidence from a western state reformatory is consistent with Clemmer's analysis when length of time served in prison is taken as the relevant time variable. When inmates are classified into phases of their institutional career, however, there is evidence of a recovery process and a shedding of the prison culture that operates prior to parole. The evidence suggests a reformulation of the effects of imprisonment on inmates and poses further problems relevant to other total institutions.

Distributive and procedural justice each plays a role in determining work outcomes of Hong Kong employees. However, some effects of these justice variables differ from results of previous studies in the United States (U.S.). First, in previous U.S. studies, procedural justice moderates the relationship of distributive justice with evaluation of supervision, but not with job satisfaction or intent to stay. For Hong Kong employees, procedural justice moderates the effects of distributive justice on job satisfaction and intent to stay, but not on evaluation of supervision. Second, previous U.S. studies have shown that procedural justice has a larger effect on work outcomes for women, while distributive justice has larger effects on outcomes for men. For Hong Kong employees, the effects of procedural and distributive justice are about the same for men and women. Differences in the effects of distributive and procedural justice between Hong Kong and the U.S. may reflect cultural dimensions, such as collectivism/individualism and power distance, as well as the relative availability of rewards for women in the work force. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Cytotoxic drugs were given only if the antitumour activity of the hormone treatment was inadequate. Hormone treatment consisted of oophorectomy for premenopausal and tamoxifen administration for postmenopausal patients. Length of survival was better, though not significantly, in premenopausal patients (p=0.29) treated concurrently and in postmenopausal women (p=0.17) treated sequentially; the difference was highly significant (p=0.003) only for postmenopausal women in the low-risk category. The findings suggest that postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer should probably be treated primarily by carefully monitored hormone treatment.

Bellen	The Journal of Cell Biology	178	2	2007-07-16T00:00:00Z	pp. 309-322	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15 (Eps15) is a protein implicated in endocytosis, endosomal protein sorting, and cytoskeletal organization. Its role is, however, still unclear, because of reasons including limitations of dominant-negative experiments and apparent redundancy with other endocytic proteins. We generated Drosophila eps 15-null mutants and show that Eps 15 is required for proper synaptic bouton development and normal levels of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis. Consistent with a role in SV endocytosis, Eps15 moves from the center of synaptic boutons to the periphery in response to synaptic activity. The endocytic protein, Dapl60/intersectin, is a major binding partner of Epsl 5, and eps 15 mutants phenotypically resemble dap 160 mutants. Analyses of eps 15 dap 160 double mutants suggest that Epsl 5 functions in concert with Dap 160 during SV endocytosis. Based on these data, we hypothesize that Eps15 and Dapl60 promote the efficiency of endocytosis from the plasma membrane by maintaining high concentrations of multiple endocytic proteins, including dynamin, at synapses.

The majority of applied research has portrayed a classical, functionalist perspective wherein development is viewed essentially as a cultural problem of the small, self-contained community. Ideals of "cultural relativism" have relegated considerations on extra-local economic and political phenomena to the realm of personal ethics. Whereas general anthropology theory has evolved well beyond this approach in past years, the problem ist that there has been little interest in investigating ways to apply the new theoretical perspectives to practical problems of development. In this article, an attempt is made to combine macro- and micro-level analyses in a study which reveals ethical and operational factors intertwining around conflicting interests. The author does not pretend to offer a solution for the pure/applied sciences dichotomy, but rather to broaden debate by analyzing her frustrations during a year's experience as consulting anthropologist in an international project promoting women's education in Upper Volta, west africa.

The main existing approaches treat all change-points equally, a priori, using either a Uniform prior or an informative hierarchical prior. Both approaches assume a known number of change-points. Some undersirable properties of these approaches are discussed. We develop a new Uniform prior that allows some of the change-points to occur out of sample. This prior has desirable properties, can be interpreted as "noninformative," and treats the number of change-points as unknown. Artificial and real data exercises show how these different priors can have a substantial impact on estimation and prediction.

Kamensky	Public Administration Review	72	4	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 592-604	American Society for Public Administration, Wiley	fla		The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the George W. Bush administration's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) established new routines that were intended to foster performance management practices. Using data from two surveys, the authors find that the involvement of agency employees in GPRA processes and PART reviews generally had little direct effect on performance information use once other factors are accounted for. The main exception is that managerial involvement in GPRA processes and PART reviews is associated with the use of performance data to refine measures andgoah. This reflects the limits of government-wide reform efforts that depend on difficult-to-observe bureaucratic behavior. The authors also find that a series of organizational factors—leadership commitment to results, learning routines led by supervisors, the motivational nature of the task, and the ability to link measures to actions—are positive predictors of performance information use.

Whereas each of these methods has several desirable properties, both require a subjective decision regarding the selection of subsets of variables that are needed to compute estimates of the parameters. An algorithm called PACE, based on an application of the sweep operator, is presented that automatically selects subsets of variables used for the Ihara-Kano estimator. A second algorithm initially presented by Du Toit (1986) is also described that automatically selects reference variables used in Hägglund's Fabin estimators. A Monte Carlo experiment is reviewed that compares the relative performance of these estimators in addition to several others. Both new methods performed well in this experiment. Their relative merits on other criteria are discussed.

Disease progression was defined as decrease in CD4⁺ cells to < 200 (14 events). At enrollment, provirus copy number was associated as decrease in CD4⁺ cell count and percentage, serum IgA, and p24 antigenemia. Elevated provirus copy number above 20 allowed indentification of patients at high risk of a subsequently decreasingCD4⁺ cell count, even after adjusting for baseline CD4⁺ cell count (P=.003). Measuring provirus copy number by PCR at early stages of HIV-1 infection could offer a useful early means to predict progression to AIDS.

The latter work contains, in particular, a rather detailed investigation of S-ancillarity in exponential families of order 2. This investigation is here extended to families of arbitrary order. Various necessary and /or sufficient conditions for a statistic to be S-ancillary are derived and the question of existence of a unique maximal S-ancillary statistic is discussed.

Westfall, Siegfried Kropf, Livio Finos	Lecture Notes-Monograph Series	47		2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 143-154	Institute of Mathematical Statistics	fla		With high dimensionality, standard Bonferroni-style procedures can suffer from loss of power, since the significance level α must be divided by k to declare significance. Kropf and Läuter (KL) show that certain data-dependent quadratic forms can be used to "pre-specify" hypotheses, which can then be tested in a fixed, data-dependent order, without multiplicity adjustment. In this article we extend the KL procedure to a class of weighted procedures, using the same quadratic forms. The class includes the KL method, the Bonferroni-Holm method, and other, new procedures. We establish strong FWE control for all procedures, and compare power and level of various weighting methods using analytical and simulation results. The method is applied using a high-dimensional mixture model that is suggested by the analysis of real gene expression data.

Mulford	Financial Management	16	3	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 45-50	Financial Management Association International, Wiley	fla		In consolidating financial statements, traditional practice has excluded finance subsidiaries from the consolidated balance sheets of their parents. A persistent concern has been that the resultant omission of finance subsidiary debt from consolidated totals would cause the financial leverage of the parent to be misjudged. This proposition was tested by comparing the degree of association of (i) pro forma consolidated measures and (ii) parent-only measures of financial leverage with (iii) the parent's systematic risk (market beta). The findings reveal that systematic risk is more highly associated with pro forma-consolidated leverage measures than those based upon parent-only data. This evidence indicates that financial leverage is not being misjudged through non-consolidation, and that market participants are performing their own pro forma consolidation of finance subsidiary debt.

It identifies constraints posed by protracted conflict on both the opportunity of the rivals to engage in mutually beneficial economic exchange and the impact of economic incentives on views on violence and peace. Based on this discussion, the study estimates regression models of Palestinians' views on diplomacy and attacks with 2001 public opinion data. The models suggest a modest role for economics. Views on Palestinian-Israeli economic integration and the economic impact of future peace exert important effects on views on diplomacy; income level and views on the economic consequences of Palestinian rebellion do not. Realist concerns appear to play the dominant role in views on attacks. Split-sample models reveal important interaction effects: the effects of economic incentives are substantively stronger and realist considerations sometimes weaker among people who deem economics the most important issue. All estimated models leave most of the variance unexplained.

Moffatt	The Journal of the Operational Research Society	56	9	2005-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1063-1071	Operational Research Society, Palgrave Macmillan Journals	fla		Some models of loan default are binary, simply modelling the probability of default, while others go further and model the extent of default (eg number of outstanding payments; amount of arrears). The double-hurdle model, originally due to Cragg (Econometrica, 1971), and conventionally applied to household consumption or labour supply decisions, contains two equations, one which determines whether or not a customer is a potential defaulter (the 'first hurdle'), and the other which determines the extent of default. In separating these two processes, the model recognizes that there exists a subset of the observed non-defaulters who would never default whatever their circumstances. A Box-Cox transformation applied to the dependent variable is a useful generalization to the model. Estimation is relatively easy using the Maximum Likelihood routine available in STATA. The model is applied to a sample of 2515 loan applicants for whom loans were approved, a sizeable proportion of whom defaulted in varying degrees. The dependent variables used are amount in arrears and number of days in arrears. The value of the hurdle approach is confirmed by finding that certain key explanatory variables have very different effects between the two equations. Most notably, the effect of loan amount is strongly positive on arrears, while being U-shaped on the probability of default. The former effect is seriously under-estimated when the first hurdle is ignored.

The numerical analysis leads to a changed perspective on the floristic data and produces, as a whole, an ecologically more differentiated classification. The groups produced by numerical analysis are almost identical with the Braun-Blanquet classification with respect to marginal site conditions but they may differ in cases of intermediate site conditions. Nevertheless, a classification emerges which is on the whole, both floristically and as to site, very similar to the Braun-Blanquet classification. The discriminatory importance of the external variables is, to a large extent, the same in both methods, but discriminant analysis shows that the numerical classification is somewhat more predictive.

Alexander, Kenneth H. Dunton	Journal of Coastal Research	22	2	2006-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 377-392	Coastal Education & Research Foundation, Inc.	fla		Reservoir construction and river diversions have dramatically reduced        freshwater inflow to coastal salt marshes of the Nueces Estuary, Texas,        facilitating hypersaline conditions. To moderate salinities and enhance habitat        quality, <tex-math>$\Tilde 7570 m^3 d^{-1}$</tex-math> of treated        wastewater effluent was used as a nutrient-rich freshwater source in the lower        estuary. For <tex-math>$\Tilde 1.5$</tex-math> years prior to and        <tex-math>$\Tilde 3.5$</tex-math> years following wastewater        diversion, we quantified salinity, inorganic nitrogen, and emergent vegetation        changes at four stations various distances downstream from the diversion point.        Wastewater prevented hypersaline conditions at station 72, closest to the        diversion, but not downstream. Increased tidal creek        <tex-math>$NH^{+4}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$NH^{-3} +        NH^{-2}$</tex-math> concentrations were detectable 1200 m downstream, but        concentrations were 50%-80% of those measured at station 72 within 325 m        downstream. Emergent vegetation responded at station 72 only. Composition        rapidly shifted (over a period of <tex-math>$\leq 1 y$</tex-math>)        from <tex-math>$\Tilde 80\percnt$</tex-math> monospecific cover of        a highly salt-tolerant succulent, Salicornia virginica, to        <tex-math>$\Tilde 50\percnt$</tex-math> cover of a less        salt-tolerant shrub, Borrichia frutescens, intermixed with several other        species. Percent cover ordination plots on each sampling date verified distinct        pre- and postdiversion plant communities at this station. Mean porewater        nutrient concentrations were not different among stations postdiversion, but        lower C: N ratios and increased <tex-math>$\delta        {15}^N$</tex-math> signatures of B. frutescens confirmed assimilation of        wastewater-derived nitrogen at station 72. A variety of plants colonized bare        areas near the diversion, creating about seven hectares of newly vegetated salt        marsh. Wastewater diversions lowered salinity, increased nutrients, and        increased cover of less salt-tolerant vegetation species near the diversion.        However, these changes were restricted to a limited area, suggesting that        increased diversions are necessary to produce substantial downstream        effects.

Because this analysis takes as data preferences technical production or exchange possibilities and an inventory of resources, it is shown incapable of being an exhaustive model of a society, but since these patterns interact in any human group, there is always a use for economic analysis in tracing how resources are allocated to needs, whether on a basis of maximization or of fixed targets. Applications of economic analysis to anthropologists' problems and alternative definitions of "the economy" are also considered.

The estimators use information from related populations, each having its own rate which is assumed distributed according to a common prior distribution about which some information is available. The study was motivated by an epidemiological study on the geographic variation of cancer mortality in the state of Missouri. Data from this study are used to illustrate the method and to compare it to a somewhat simpler empirical Bayes method.

Design-This was a prospective randomised cohort study with mother and infant follow-up sample stratified on level of maternal alcohol intake. Setting-A large maternity hospital in Western Australia. Participants-2002 randomly selected pregnant women were recruited over a 3 year period for questionnaire survey (19 mothers refused participation). From 665 women in a stratified subsample selected on the basis of prepregnancy alcohol consumption, 605 newborns were available for study. Investigation and main results-All 2002 women completed a comprehensive questionnaire on demographic, lifestyle (including diet), health, and obstetric factors. Of the 665 mothers who were followed through pregnancy, 605 liveborns were available at birth for measurement and detailed clinical evaluation. Low to moderate prepregnancy maternal alcohol intake was not associated with any untoward effect upon weight, length, head circumference at birth, or clinical well-being as indicated by Apgar score, respiratory distress syndrome, and overall clinical state. Other factors, particularly nicotine, were of much greater importance. Conclusions-This study fails to show any significant relationship between low to moderate prepregnancy maternal alcohol intake and newborn clinical status. The outcome suggests that cautionary advice to pregnant women warning that any alcohol taken during pregnancy is potentially harmful to the fetus is inaccurate and therefore probably counterproductive.

Series C (Applied Statistics)	33	1	1984-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 52-64	Royal Statistical Society, Wiley	fla		The interpretation of a fitted statistical model such as the classical linear or the generalized linear model is substantially clarified by a full partitioning of the maximized log-likelihood ratio test statistic into additive elements. This method generalizes the regression elements of Newton and Spurrell (1967) used to aid interpretation of regression equations. The primary elements measure the unique contribution of each explanatory variable whereas the secondary and higher order elements measure the effective balance in the observed design. It is remarked herein that the elements correspond to the parameters of a saturated factorial model fitted to the likelihood function. This permits a coherent computational procedure. Examples are taken from some well-analysed data sets illustrating the interpretation of regression and log-linear models.

Trudeau	Physiological and Biochemical Zoology	84	2	2011-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 135-146	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Abstract Previous attempts at identifying an alternatively spliced dopamine (DA) D2 receptor in teleosts have proven unsuccessful. We provide evidence of a splicing event of a goldfish D2 (gfD2b1) receptor in the neuroendocrine brain of adult goldfish that produces a spliced short isoform (gfD2b1S). We also identify an additional novel D2b paralog (gfD2b2) that does not appear to be alternatively spliced in adult fish during the reproductive cycle. Relatively high mRNA levels of gfD2b1S were observed in the neuroendocrine brain and pituitary of sexually immature fish compared with sexually regressing fish. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that intraperitoneal injection of either SCH 23390 or sulpiride—D1- or D2-specific antagonists, respectively—decreased mRNA levels of gfD2b1S by 3.9-fold without affecting the unspliced isoforms. We suggest that the expression of the spliced D2 receptor modulates the inhibitory tone of DA throughout the reproductive cycle. The deduced amino acid sequence of gfD2b1S lacks 29 amino acids in the same region as the short isoform of mammalian D2. We propose that the gfD2b1S splice variant is the teleost ortholog of mammalian D2S. The hypothesis that D2 receptor splicing is a relatively recent innovation in higher tetrapods is not supported by our results.

Despite appreciation in the academic literature for the historical patterns and processes of deforestation, however, a simplistic, linear 'deforestation narrative' persists in the popular imagination. Concern arises when this narrative influences environmental policy and effective response to the tropical deforestation problem. Our main goals here are twofold: (1) to contribute to a nuanced history of forest change in southeastern Mexico; and (2) to explore the role of institutional development in reducing deforestation rates. Drawing on forest transition theory, we analyse the twentieth century forest histories of the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, the southern Yucatán Peninsula, and the Lacandón Rainforest. A deforestation narrative rightly dominates characterisations of the 1960–85 period in southeastern Mexico, but it falls short of accurately representing the complex processes of deforestation, forest recovery, and the development of sustainability-oriented grassroots institutions in the 1985–2003 period.

This method is often invoked by scholars who carry out within-case analysis based on qualitative data, yet frequently it is neither adequately understood nor rigorously applied. This deficit motivates this article, which offers a new framework for carrying out process tracing. The reformulation integrates discussions of process tracing and causal-process observations, gives greater attention to description as a key contribution, and emphasizes the causal sequence in which process-tracing observations can be situated. In the current period of major innovation in quantitative tools for causal inference, this reformulation is part of a wider, parallel effort to achieve greater systematization of qualitative methods. A key point here is that these methods can add inferential leverage that is often lacking in quantitative analysis. This article is accompanied by online teaching exercises, focused on four examples from American politics, two from comparative politics, three from international relations, and one from public health/epidemiology.

At both sites, vegetation development from the lateglacial until after the arrival of Neolithic people is recorded. An initial lateglacial heath, interrupted by a herbaceous phase indicating the Younger Dryas, was replaced by tallherb and grassland vegetation. The Saksunarvatn ash layer was recorded, coinciding with the arrival of Corylus avellana in the islands at around 92 ka BP. Extensive woodland developed at about 8000 yr BP, predominantly Betula-Corylus with Salix, Alnus glutinosa, Quercus and Pinus sylvestris occasionally present. The woodland was locally affected by Mesolithic human activity and finally lost at around 5 ka BP, partly as a consequence of Neolithic human activity. Mire development was actively proceeding in both basins after the woodland decline. The records illustrate the importance of human activity in the development of the treeless, varied landscape seen in Orkney today.

During stress, a few mesophyll cells in T. caerulescens became more inhibited and accumulated more Cd than the majority; this heterogeneity disappeared during acclimation. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters related to photochemistry were more strongly affected by Cd stress than nonphotochemical parameters, and only photochemistry showed acclimation.  $\bullet$  Cd acclimation in T. caerulescens shows that part of its Cd tolerance is inducible and involves transient physiological heterogeneity as an emergency defence mechanism. Differential effects of Cd stress on photochemical vs nonphotochemical parameters indicate that Cd inhibits the photosynthetic light reactions more than the Calvin-Benson cycle. Differential spectral distribution of Cd effects on photochemical vs nonphotochemical quenching shows that Cd inhibits at least two different targets in/around photosystem II (PSII). Spectrally homogeneous maximal PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm) suggests that in healthy T caerulescens all chlorophylls fluorescing at room temperature are PSII-associated.

The I-T approaches can replace the usual t tests and ANOVA tables that are so inferentially limited, but still commonly used. The I-T methods are easy to compute and understand and provide formal measures of the strength of evidence for both the null and alternative hypotheses, given the data. We give an example to highlight the importance of deriving alternative hypotheses and representing these as probability models. Fifteen technical issues are addressed to clarify various points that have appeared incorrectly in the recent literature. We offer several remarks regarding the future of empirical science and data analysis under an I-T framework.

This article provides a useful corrective to an overemphasis on the extractive nature of the colonial economy of sugar and shows the truly industrial nature of plantation production. For students of colonial science and agriculture, the situation has additional ramifications, relating both to the role and 'diffusion' of scientific knowledge and to the historical dimensions of agricultural development in 'the tropics'.

Davis	Weed Science	55	2	2007-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 123-128	Allen Press, Weed Science Society of America	fla		Weed seed persistence in the soil seedbank is central to weed population dynamics; however, limited knowledge of mechanisms regulating seed survival in soil remains an obstacle to developing seed-bank management practices. Weed seeds are rich in carbon and nitrogen, and therefore may represent an important nutritional resource to soil microbes. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that weed seed mortality due to microbial predation is limited by soil inorganic N availability and soil C:N ratio. A factorial of N fertilizer rate ( $0, 14, and 28 mg N kg soil^{-1}$ ) and corn stover addition rate ( $0 and 3,000 mg stover kg soil^{-1}$ ) was applied to bioassay units containing Illinois field soil (silt loam, 3.8% organic carbon) and seeds of one of eight annual weed species common to Illinois field crops: giant foxtail, green foxtail, yellow foxtail, wooly cupgrass, giant ragweed, redroot pigweed, velvetleaf, and Venice mallow. Seeds were incubated for 2 mo, after which they were recovered from the soil and tested for viability. Only three of the eight species, velvetleaf, giant ragweed, and wooly cupgrass, responded to the experimental treatments. Velvetleaf seed mortality was 40% lower in the corn stover-amended treatment than in the unamended treatment. Both giant ragweed and wooly cupgrass showed a more complex interaction between N fertilizer and corn stover treatments. Path analysis supported the hypothesis that the influence of soil N on seed mortality in velvetleaf was because of the direct effect of soil N on microbial predation of velvetleaf seeds, whereas for giant ragweed and wooly cupgrass, the effect on seed mortality appeared to be mediated through soil N effects on germination. Mechanisms underlying soil N fertility effects on weed seed mortality appear to be species-specific. Future investigations of this phenomenon should include quantitative measures of seed coat composition and quality.

Such a search is destined to fail, given that car crashes and unsafe driving behaviors can result from myriad interacting factors. This review highlights the main problems of the current assessment methods and training programs and presents theoretical and empirical arguments justifying the need of reorienting the research focus. In our discussion, we elaborate the fundamental principle of specificity in learning and practice. We also identify overlooked variables that are deterministic when assessing and training a complex ability like driving. We especially focus on the role of the sensorimotor transformation process. Finally, we propose alternative methods of assessment and training that, in line with recent trends in education, use virtual reality and simulation technologies.

Gray	American Sociological Review	36	3	1971-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 496-502	American Sociological Association	fla		There exists a variety of situations in which the dispersion of data, rather than their mean or other central value, is of interest. The coefficient of variation, which is a measure of dispersion divided by the appropriate measure of central tendency, is preferable to a raw measure of dispersion for this purpose. However, these measures do not have a constant range, and the common practice of dividing the variation value obtained by 100 and expressing the result as a per cent is particularly inappropriate, as all have maxima larger than unity for  $n > 2$ . The present paper provides standardization procedures for coefficients of variation. The resulting standardized coefficients (called S-measures) have a zero-to-one range, and the common practice of dividing the variation value obtained by 100 and deviation) for descriptive purposes is demonstrated. It is suggested that S-measures replace, or at least supplement, coefficients of variation and raw dispersion measures when the problem of interest is relative dispersion between groups.

But does this mean that there is causation between the results? I argue that it does, according to Lewis's counterfactual analysis of causation and his associated views. The reason lies in his doctrine that chances evolve by conditionalization on intervening history. This doctrine collapses the distinction between the conditional probabilities that are used to state screening off, and the counterfactuals with chance consequents that are used to state lack of causation. I briefly discuss ways to evade my argument.

Rosskopf	Mycologia	93	2	2001-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 323-334	Mycological Society of America	fla		Phylogenetic relationships among isolates of Cercospora species pathogenic to water hyacinth, collected from several geographic regions of the world, were examined by using partial DNA sequences from three protein-coding genes: elongation factor-1α, β-tubulin, and histone H3. In cladograms from individual, as well as from combined datasets for 14 isolates, two statistically well supported clades were found: a major clade that included isolates from Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, Florida (USA), South Africa, and Zambia; and a minor clade restricted to isolates from Texas (USA). Shape and dimensions of conidia were unreliable criteria for taxonomic differentiation of most isolates that composed the two clades. In addition, the ex-type culture of C. rodmanii did not show differences in DNA sequence in relation to the other isolates grouped in the major clade, including some that had conidial size and morphology fitting the description of C. piaropi. Therefore, the separation of these species not only did not have strong phenotypic support, but also did not have support from the phylogenetic analysis. Consequently, the description of C. piaropi is emended herein to include C. rodmanii as a synonym.

Round	The Journal of Economic Education	32	3	2001-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 203-218	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States experienced a substantial decline in undergraduate degrees in economics from 1992 through 1996, followed immediately by a modest recovery. This cycle does not conform to overall degree trends, shifts in the gender composition of undergraduate populations, or changing interests of female students in any of the four countries. There is no evidence that changes in the "price" of a degree to students, tightened marking standards or degree requirements, or changes in pedagogical methods caused the cycle. Jobs for economics graduates declined in the United States between 1988 and 1990 and thereafter recovered. With a two-year recognition lag, the pattern of employment prospects fits the U. S. slump in economics degrees perfectly. Unfortunately, employment patterns in the other three countries are inconsistent with the degree cycle. The explanation that fits the economic degree pattern best is interest in business education.

Romberger	American Journal of Botany	59	6	1972-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 587-597	Botanical Society of America	fla		Developing embryos in immature Picea abies seeds already have well-delineated shoot apical meristems with clearly evident cytohistological zonation. During early seedling development the zonation characteristic of gymnospermous apical meristems is attained. Seedling development is also accompanied by an approximately threefold increase in apical dome diameter. The latter approaches a steady state about 140 days after germination. Seedlings display a spiral phyllotaxis consisting of a contact parastichy system, usually of the primary Fibonacci series. As the seedlings age and apical domes enlarge, higher Fibonacci number-pairs characterize their phyllotaxis. Mathematical analysis of the relation between cumulative leaf number and age revealed that the length of the plastochronic time interval declines from about 18.5 hr to 5.7 hr as seedling age increases from 20 to 140 days.

David	Evolution	50	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 2346-2353	Society for the Study of Evolution	fla		Phenotypic plasticity of abdomen pigmentation was investigated in populations of the sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, living in sympatry in two French localities. Ten isofemale lines of each population and species were grown at different constant temperatures spanning their complete thermal range from 12 to 31⚬C. Genetic variability between isofemale lines was not affected by growth temperature, but was consistently less in D. simulans. For all traits, the dark pigmentation of the abdominal segments decreased according to growth temperature, in agreement with the thermal budget adaptive hypothesis. The shapes of the response curves were different between the abdominal segments, but for a given segment, quite similar in the two species. On average D. simulans was lighter than D. melanogaster, but the difference was mainly expressed at higher temperatures. An interesting result was the difference observed between the two localities: flies from the colder locality (Villeurbanne) were found to be darker than flies from the warmer locality (Bordeaux). Interestingly, this difference was expressed only at low temperatures, 21⚬C and below, that is, at temperatures encountered in natural conditions. This suggests an adaptive response resulting in a change of the shape of reaction norm and involving genotype-environment interactions. When comparing the genetic structure of geographic populations for quantitative traits, several laboratory environments should be preferred to a single one.

Reports have suggested that the epidemiological profile of invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections is changing. We sought to describe the epidemiological profile of S. aureus bacteremia and to assess whether the incidence and severity of and the antimicrobial resistance rates associated with this bacteremia are increasing. Methods. Population-based surveillance for S. aureus bacteremias was conducted in the Calgary Health Region (population, 1.2 million) during 2000-2006. Results. The annual incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was 19.7 cases/100,000 population. Although rates of health care-associated and nosocomial methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia were similar throughout the study, rates of community- acquired MSSA bacteremia gradually decreased, and rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia dramatically increased. The donal type predominantly isolated was CMRSA-2 (i.e., Canadian [C] MRSA-2), but CMRSA-10 (USA300) strains have been increasingly isolated, especially from communityonset infections, since 2004. Dialysis dependence, organ transplantation, HIV infection, cancer, and diabetes were the most important risk factors and were comparable for MSSA and MRSA bacteremias. The overall case-fatality rate was higher among individuals with MRSA (39%) than among those with MSSA (24%; P < .0001). The annual overall population mortality rate associated with S. aureus bacteremia did not significantly change during the study. Conclusions. Although the overall influence of S. aureus bacteremia has not significantly changed, MRSA has emerged as an important etiology in our region.

Slagle	The Great Basin Naturalist	48	3	1988-07-31T00:00:00Z	pp. 327-333	Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum, Brigham Young University	fla		This study was designed to characterize arboreal arthropod community structure in an early successional coniferous ecosystem. We sampled six-year-old snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus Dougl. ex Hook) and Douglasfir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon during 1982. The arthropod fauna was dominated in terms of densities by psyllids and aphids on snowbrush and by adelgids and cecidomyiids on Douglas-fir. Significant associations among taxa, e.g., positive correlation between aphids and ants, indicated trophic interactions or similar responses to host conditions. Significant seasonality was observed for individual taxa and for the community, reflecting the integration of individual life-history patterns. Significant spatial pattern (patchiness) in the arthropod community may reflect the influence of faunas on individual plants within neighborhoods and/or the influence of ant foraging patterns.

Yet the critique offered by heterodoxy speaks more widely. This study examines the diffusion of heterodox economic ideas beyond the immediate confines via an analysis of the citation of heterodox economic journals by other journals. The diffusion of heterodox economics across wider disciplines is traced utilizing data from Emerald, Wiley, and Sage bibliographic databases. Employing the techniques of social network analysis, key journals in the diffusion process are identified, with implications for heterodox economics publishing strategy and engagement in valuation processes.

Spencer	Journal of Mammalogy	79	1	1998-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 204-214	American Society of Mammalogists	fla		Competitive interactions between coyotes (Canis latrans) and federally endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) were investigated at the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California (NPRC) during 1984-1995. Coyotes and kit foxes used similar food items, indicating the potential for exploitative competition. Leporids were the primary prey for coyotes in all years, but small rodents were the primary prey for kit foxes in most years, although leporids were primary prey in other years. Coyotes were the main cause of mortality to kit foxes at NPRC, indicating that interference competition may be occurring. Population trends of kit foxes appeared to be strongly influenced by food availability, but competition from coyotes also may have affected population dynamics of kit foxes. Mechanisms employed by kit foxes, such as resource partitioning, greater dietary breadth, and year-round den use, may facilitate coexistence with coyotes. However, use of anthropogenic food sources by coyotes may intensify competitive interactions during periods of low prey availability.

The permanent and temporary migration streams are shown to have similar patterns, but the volume of the temporary migration streams greatly outnumbers that of the permanent streams. A human ecological model of migration is proposed and tested, and its results are compared with those of a gravity model of migration. Of the various ecological variables examined in the models, investment levels at destination, and being a coastal province at destination, all have strong effects on migration. The effects of the independent variables are more similar than different with regard to predicting the permanent and the temporary migration streams.

Patzkowsky	PALAIOS	22	4	2007-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 392-407	SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology	fla		Recent studies have emphasized that faunal change is typically brief and most commonly occurs at sequence boundaries and major flooding surfaces. The Upper Ordovician of the Cincinnati, Ohio, region records a major biotic invasion in the Richmondian Stage, which offers an opportunity to test these generalizations and to understand how episodes of faunal change are reflected in the structure of ecological gradients. The early Cincinnatian (C1–early C4 depositional sequences) displays two relatively stable faunal gradients, with the primary gradient reflecting onshore-offshore setting and the secondary gradient reflecting substrate consistency. During the mid-C4 sequence, dominant taxa of the shallow subtidal are extirpated, while deep subtidal taxa expand into those habitats, leading to a loss of cross-shelf faunal differentiation. This faunal breakdown is accompanied into the mid-C5 by a series of ecological epiboles, indicating an ongoing flux in ecological associations. The onshore-offshore gradient is reestablished in the C5, albeit with new associations dominated by or containing immigrant taxa. Recognition of this gradient is hindered by widespread increased abundance of bryozoans and by the delayed appearance of at least seven common genera of brachiopods and corals. The Richmondian Invasion plays out over multiple sequences and is not confined to a brief interval at the beginning of a sequence. These faunal changes do not coincide with sequence boundaries or major flooding surfaces and therefore cannot be sequence stratigraphic artifacts, nor can they represent a geologically instantaneous faunal response to sea-level change.

Thorn	Arctic and Alpine Research	14	4	1982-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 361-367	INSTAAR, University of Colorado	fla		Alpine subnival boulder pavements occur as two types: Type I, those associated with a stream; Type II, those with no stream present. Type I may be subdivided into Type Ia, pavements that are approximately rectangular with their long axes roughly orthogonal to snow-delivering winds; and Type Ib, pavements that are fan-like in plan with a centrally located stream. Type Ia pavements have three internal zones: zone 1, occupied by the stream; zone 2, the sheltered margin with deep snowpack accumulation; and zone 3, the downwind margin with only shallow snowpack accumulation. Type Ib pavements have only zones 1 and 2. Using this typology and zonation, together with data from five pavements in the Indian Peaks, Colorado Front Range, three hypotheses were tested statistically. Hypothesis 1, that streams scour fines from beneath a coarse surficial layer, is accepted. Hypothesis 2, that pavement roughness is inversely related to seasonal snowpack mass, remains uncertain. Such a relationship does occur, but is probably secondary to stream scour. Hypothesis 3, that pavements may be either autochthonous or allochthonous, remains indeterminate.

By comparing the self-sufficiency of each SMA to the self-sufficiency of its urbanized area and of an areal unit made up of the SMA plus contiguous counties, the quality of each SMA is evaluated. Each SMA is classified as being either overbounded, underbounded or truebounded. The type of boundary discrepancy exhibited by an SMA is strongly related to its degree of proximity to other SMA's and is unrelated to its population size.

These shortfalls include disenfranchisement, unequal influence operating through formal and informal mechanisms, political apathy and alienation, misinformation, and misperception. Part of the solutions to these challenges lies in a sound democratic constitution. But there is no once-and-for-all solution. Instead, approaching the democratic ideal requires political practices of continuous democratic innovation. The need for continuous innovation stems from a fundamental dynamics of democratic sclerosis in which advantaged individuals and factions in society will seek to entrench their authority and so disempower others. That innovation, in turn, requires a certain civic infrastructure and political practices. Elements of that infrastructure include citizens who look forward restlessly to democratic improvements rather than reverentially backward to an imagined golden democratic age, political leaders and advocates who press not just for their policy preferences but for improvements in the processes of democratic governance, and an intellectual class that offers not just explanations of political phenomena, but solutions to democracy's problems.

We offer a comment on his essay and further contend that it is naïve to proceed on the assumption that a barrier exists between the biological and social sciences, such that the biological sciences have nothing to offer the social sciences. If we look beyond our discipline's current theoretical models we may find a more thorough, and not just competing, explanation of political behavior.

When these two variables were compared, the quality of reporting was acceptable in 89·7% of instances, and data editing enabled accuracy to be improved. Reporting was more reliable with shorter duration of recall, and female workers' reports were somewhat more reliable than those of male workers. The distribution of time taken to conceive was similar for male workers to that observed in previously published prospective series, though with a higher estimate of subfertility when infertile phases were also considered. Comparison with published estimates of reduced fertility appeared to be reassuring. As predicted, the equivalent comparisons for female workers showed the presence of a strong selection effect.

Missing values can be filled in using multiple imputation, but imputation is tricky if the regression includes interactions, squares, or other transformations of the regressors. In this paper, we examine different approaches to imputing transformed variables; and we find one simple method that works well across a variety of circumstances. Our recommendation is to transform, then impute—i. e., calculate the interactions or squares in the incomplete data and then impute these transformations like any other variable. The transform-then-impute method yields good regression estimates, even though the imputed values are often inconsistent with one another. It is tempting to try and "fix" the inconsistencies in the imputed values, but methods that do so lead to biased regression estimates. Such biased methods include the passive imputation strategy implemented by the popular ice command for Stata.

But considerable inequalities also exist within occupational classes by career history. Changes in the labour market and occupational pathways in recent decades -notably among women -have altered the composition of occupational classes and their average mortality levels. This article analyses the changes in mortality differentials between occupational classes by studying occupational mobility and associated mortality using data from the permanent demographic sample (Échantillon démographique permanent, EDP), a long-term sample representative of the French population at different dates. Analysis of mortality in 1975 (EDP75) and 1999 (EDP99) by occupational class and past occupational moves shows that mortality has declined for all classes but in different ways, causing a slight widening of differentials for both sexes. Within occupational classes, differentials by past moves increased in the EDP99 for men and were now observed in all classes for women. Changes in the composition of occupational classes and in excess mortality associated with certain moves has contributed to this increase in inequalities between occupational classes. This finding highlights the importance of interpreting changes in mortality differentials in the light of sociodemographic developments. Les inégalités de mortalité entre les professions et catégories socioprofessionnelles françaises (PCS) sont importantes et en augmentation. Mais il existe aussi de larges inégalités de mortalité au sein des PCS selon la nature des carrières passées. Les transformations du marché du travail et des parcours professionnels dans les dernières décennies, notamment pour les femmes, modifient la composition des PCS et leur niveau moyen de mortalité. Cet article analyse l'évolution des inégalités de mortalité entre les PCS à travers l'étude des mobilités professionnelles et de la mortalité associée, en utilisant les données de l'Échantillon démographique permanent (EDP), un échantillon suivi et représentatif de la population française à différentes dates. L'étude de la mortalité en 1975 (EDP75) et en 1999 (EDP99), selon les PCS et les mobilités professionnelles passées, montre que la mortalité a baissé pour toutes les PCS mais de façon différente, aboutissant à un léger creusement des écarts pour les deux sexes. Au sein des PCS, les écarts selon les mobilités passées sont renforcés dans TEDP99 pour les hommes et se généralisent pour les femmes. La modification de la composition des PCS et l'évolution de la surmortalité associée à certaines mobilités a contribué à cette augmentation des inégalités entre PCS. Interpréter l'évolution des inégalités de mortalité à la lumière des changements sociodémographiques s'avère donc particulièrement important. Las desigualdades de mortalidad entre las profesiones y categorías socio-profesionales francesas (PCS) son importantes y están todavía aumentando. Pero existen también amplias diferencias de mortalidad dentro de las PCS según la naturaleza de la carrera pasada. Las transformaciones del mercado del trabajo y de los recorridos socio-profesionales en las ultimas décadas, particularmente en las mujeres, han modificado la composición de las PCS y su nivel medio de mortalidad. Este articulo analiza la evolución de las desigualdades de mortalidad entre las PCS a través del estudio de la movilidad profesional y de la mortalidad asociada, utilizando los datos del Echantillon démographique permanent (EDP) , es decir un panel observado en continuo y representativo de la población francesa en diferentes fechas. El estudio de la mortalidad en 1975 (EDP1975) y en 1999 (EDP99), según la PCS y la movilidad profesional pasada, muestra que la mortalidad ha disminuido en todas las PCS pero de manera diferente, abocando a un ligero ahondamiento de las diferencias tanto en los hombres como en las mujeres. En el EDP99, dentro de las PCS, las diferencias según la movilidad pasada se refuerzan en los hombres y se generalizan en las mujeres. La modificación de la composición de las PCS y la evolución del exceso de mortalidad asociado a ciertas movilidades han contribuido al aumento de las diferencias entre las PCS. Interpretar la evolución de las desigualdades de mortalidad a la luz de los cambios socio-demográficos se revela pues particularmente importante.

Eighty-three cancer cases were each age matched with two male controls-one with benign prostatic hypertrophy and one other non-cancer patient. Analysis from pooled data showed a statistically significant difference for syphilis infection between cases and controls at p&lt;0·05; odds ratio 2·9. Matched pair analysis maintained p&lt;0·05 significance for the first control group but odds ratios were 5·5 and 2·75 in respect of control groups 1 and 2. The mean age at which venereal infection was acquired was higher for syphilis than for gonorrhoea, but the mean age at diagnosis of cancer was younger for the syphilis group; there was a statistically significant difference between the mean at cancer diagnosis of those who had syphilis and those who had no record of previous venereal infection (t = 2·18, df 70, p&lt;0·05). No association was demonstrated for history of treatment with arsenical drugs.

Chen	Journal of Medical Ethics	34	5	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 336-340	BMJ Publishing Group	fla		Objectives: To investigate the current situation of completing the informed consent for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders among the competent patients with terminal illness and the ethical dilemmas related to it. Participants: This study enrolled 152 competent patients with terminal cancer, who were involved in the initial consultations for hospice care. Analysis: Comparisons of means, analyses of variance, Student's test, χ2 test and multiple logistic regression models. Results: After the consultations, 117 (77.0%) of the 152 patients provided informed consent for hospice care and DNR orders. These included 21 patients (17.9%) who signed the consent by themselves, and 96 (82.1%) whose consent sheet was signed only by family members. The reasons why patients were not involved in the discussions toward the consent (n = 82) included poor physical or psychological condition (44.9%), concerns of the consultant hospice team (37.2%), and the family's refusal (28.2%). On a multivariate analysis, patients' awareness of their poor prognosis (odds ratio = 4.07, 95% confidence interval = 2.05 to 8.07) and their understanding of hospice care (2.27, 1.33 to 3.89) were two independent factors (p<0.01) that influenced their participation in the discussions or their personal signature in the informed consent. Conclusion: The family-oriented culture in Asian countries may violate the principles of the Patient Self-Determination Act and the requirements of the Hospice Care Law in Taiwan, which inevitably poses an ethical dilemma. Earlier truth-telling and continuing education of the public by hospice care workers will be helpful in solving such ethical dilemmas.

A field experiment compared the effects of herbicide treatments (picloram, clopyralid and clopyralid + 2,4-D, each at two timings, at the recommended rates for control of the exotic forb Centaurea maculosa) on the structure and species diversity of native plant communities during an 8-year period in western Montana, USA. 2. Floristic composition of replicated treatment plots was sampled before spraying and for 3 years after the initial herbicide applications at two grassland and two early seral forest sites. Following the third year post-spray measurements, half the treatment plots were randomly selected to be resprayed and community sampling was continued for two more years. Diversity was quantified as species richness and Shannon Diversity Index. 3. Standing crops by growth form were estimated by double sampling at the conclusion of the experiment. 4. Herbicide treatments had high efficacy on the target weed, shifting the plant communities back to a grass-dominated structure. 5. Depressions in plant community diversity were small and transitory. In the third year after the initial applications, there were no significant differences among treatments and some herbicide-treated plots had begun to surpass the untreated plots in community diversity measures. With most treatments, respraying 3-4 years after the initial applications did not reduce plant diversity compared to untreated levels. 6. Late season applications, made after most herbicide-susceptible forbs had entered summer drought-induced dormancy, minimized impacts on plant community diversity. 7. The behaviour of herbicide residues in the soil is described in relation to community-level effects. 8. Implications of the results for exotic weed management in conservation settings are discussed.

McKeigue	Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1979-)	46	5	1992-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 532-536	BMJ Publishing Group	fla		Study objective-The aim was to compare the ability of census based social deprivation scores devised by Jarman, Carstairs, and Townsend to predict workload in general practice. Design-This was a prospective study of 140 050 patients registered with general practices over one year from 1 July 1981 (Third National Morbidity Survey). Main outcome measures were workload score for each patient, defined as a weighted sum of consultations at the surgery and consultations elsewhere, excluding preventive procedures. Setting-25 general practices in England and Wales. Main results-In multivariate analyses the Jarman, Carstairs, and Townsend indices all predicted workload, but the Townsend index was the best predictor, with both housing tenure and car ownership being strong predictors of workload. The overcrowding and geographical mobility variables used in the Jarman index did not predict increased workload. The weighting assigned to children under five by the Jarman index underestimated the additional workload this group generated. Conclusions-For identifying social pressures on general practice workload the Jarman index is less valid than other census based scores because it fails to include car ownership and housing tenure. A more rational scheme for compensating general practitioners would directly weight the capitation fee for children aged under five years and allocate current deprivation payments according to the Townsend index or a similar score. This would redistribute resources from London to deprived areas in northern England.

L. Hall	New Phytologist	121	4	1992-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 535-543	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		The acid and alkaline invertases of mature leaves of Pisum sativum were partially purified and characterized prior to determining the effects of powdery mildew (Erysiphe pisi) infection on their activities. Seven days after inoculation, infection resulted in significant increases in the activities of both acid and alkaline invertases in whole leaves of cv. Onward, but a significant increase in the activity of only alkaline invertase in isolated mesophyll of cv. Argenteum. Activity of α-glucosidase was determined in leaves and it was concluded that this enzyme could not be responsible for the increased sucrose hydrolase activity observed in host tissues. Seven days after inoculation, infection caused a significant decrease in leaf starch content, a decrease in the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and no significant change in the activity of α-glucan phosphorylase or content of inorganic phosphate. It was proposed that the decreased content of starch is a result of decreased starch synthesis.

Cells derived from patients with BS exhibit an elevated rate of somatic recombination and hypermutability, supporting a role for bleomycin (BLM) in the maintenance of genomic integrity. BLM is thought to participate in several DNA transactions, the failure of which could give raise to genomic instability, and to interact with many proteins involved in replication, recombination, and repair. In this study, we show that BLM function is specifically required to properly relocalize the RAD50/MRE11/NBS1 (RMN) complex at sites of replication arrest, but is not essential in the activation of BRCA1 either after stalled replication forks or γ-rays. We also provide evidence that BLM is phosphorylated after replication arrest in an Ataxia and RAD3-related protein (ATR)-dependent manner and that phosphorylation is not required for subnuclear relocalization. Therefore, in ATR dominant negative mutant cells, the assembly of the RMN complex in nuclear foci after replication blockage is almost completely abolished. Together, these results suggest a relationship between BLM, ATR, and the RMN complex in the response to replication arrest, proposing a role for BLM protein and RMN complex in the resolution of stalled replication forks.

Boltz	Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal	28	4	2011-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 367-386	University of California Press	fla		Recent research in music cognition has investigated ways in which different structural dimensions interact to influence perception and cognition. In the present research, various musical characteristics were manipulated to observe their potential influence on perceived tempo. In Experiment 1, participants were given a paired comparison task in which music-like patterns differed in both the pitch octave (high vs. low) and timbre (bright vs. dull) in which they were played. The results indicated that relative to their standard referents, comparison melodies were judged faster when displaying a higher pitch and/or a brighter timbre—even when no actual tempo differences existed. Experiment 2 converged on these findings by demonstrating that the perceived tempo of a melody was judged faster when it increased in pitch and/or loudness over time. These results are suggested to stem from an overgeneralization of certain structural correlations within the natural environment that, in turn, has implications for both musical performance and the processing of tempo information.

Jolly	Population and Environment	16	1	1994-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 61-90	Springer	fla		This paper evaluates current theories of the relationship between population change and the environment, particularly land use, in developing countries. Specifically, this paper critically reviews the literature and suggests what demographers can contribute to testing these theories. The literature can be divided into four main theoretical frameworks. Population growth plays a different role in each of these theories. (1) For the neoclassical economists, high population growth is a neutral factor; it has no intrinsic effect on the environment. How population growth affects the environment depends on whether free market policies are operative. In an efficient market, population growth can serve to induce innovation and the development of advanced technologies. In an economy full of distortions, high population growth can exacerbate the effects of these distortions. (2) For the classical economists or natural scientists, high population growth is the independent factor causing environmental degradation. As an increasing population puts pressure on fixed available resources to maintain or increase the population's standard of living, environmental degradation occurs as resources are depleted. Empirical work has generally centered on estimating the carrying capacity of land to determine what size population can be supported, given available resources. (3) For many dependency theorists, high population growth is a symptom of a deeper problem, poverty. Environmental degradation and high population growth are linked, not in that one causes the other, but in that their root cause is the same: unequal distribution of resources maintained by distorted political and economic relations.

Further, we find that job- or location-specific resources, prestige and wage deter migration.

Gregory Matera, Tom Misteli	The Journal of Cell Biology	164	6	2004-03-15T00:00:00Z	pp. 831-842	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		Cajal bodies (CBs) are subnuclear domains implicated in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. In most cell types, CBs coincide with nuclear gems, which contain the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex, an essential snRNP assembly factor. Here, we analyze the exchange kinetics of multiple components of CBs and gems in living cells using photobleaching microscopy. We demonstrate differences in dissociation kinetics of CB constituents and relate them to their functions. Coilin and SMN complex members exhibit relatively long CB residence times, whereas components of snRNPs, small nucleolar RNPs, and factors shared with the nucleolus have significantly shorter residence times. Comparison of the dissociation kinetics of these shared proteins from either the nucleolus or the CB suggests the existence of compartment-specific retention mechanisms. The dynamic properties of several CB components do not depend on their interaction with coilin because their dissociation kinetics are unaltered in residual nuclear bodies of coilin knockout cells. Photobleaching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrate that coilin and SMN can interact within CBs, but their interaction is not the major determinant of their residence times. These results suggest that CBs and gems are kinetically independent structures.

Our tests with high probability correctly detect utility maximization for data generated with measurement error. The procedures are not very sensitive to misspecifying the amount of error that could have caused the data to violate revealed preference. The tests have power against an alternative of random behavior. Both tests fail to reject the null of rational utility maximization from a monetary dataset that has violations of revealed preference.

Hartigan	Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)	52	4	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 780-790	Water Environment Federation	fla		A year-long study was conducted in the Occoquan and Four-Mile Run basins of northern Virginia to determine the effect of land use on the quantity and quality of runoff from the receiving area of small catchments. Twenty-one sites were selected ranging from undisturbed forest land to highly urbanized sites. All runoff events at all operable stations were monitored for flow and pollutant load. The results were analyzed using nonparametric statistical methods. Analysis showed that pollutant yield from residential/urban sites increased monotonically as the percentage imperviousness of the catchment receiving area increased for most pollutants. The flushing characteristics of runoff events from different sites were also investigated. It was found that insoluble pollutants exhibited a first flush response while soluble pollutants did not.

Comparing study results across time has identified several interesting findings about Russian quality practices. Results from the study indicate that in the three years since economic reform Russian factories are making progress at improving product quality. From 1989 to 1992, Russian factory workers have observed significant improvement in the level of product quality at their factories. One reason for this change is the relative priority that Russian managers are giving quality higher priority in 1992. Another reason for this improvement is that Russian factories have appeared to have evolved from a defect detection orientation to a defect prevention orientation.

Although runs tests based on the binomial distribution are commonly used to detect nonrandomness within a sequence, many research situations require tests based on the multinomial distribution. We propose a test of randomness versus clustering based on the number of runs in multinomial data. We illustrate its use with data from a mass communication experiment using a constrained free recall procedure.

Differences seem to mirror the political cultures with which these three states have been identified: Nevada, individualistic; Minnesota, moralistic; and South Carolina, traditionalistic. Because the family policies that states enact make a difference to families and to the practice of family professionals, family professionals must take an active role in making sure the states in which they live and work enact policies that enhance, and not diminish, family life.

Zeithaml	Journal of Marketing	68	1	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 109-127	American Marketing Association	fla		The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return.

Van Osselaer, Chris Janiszewski	Journal of Consumer Research	37	3	2010-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 473-489	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Changing brand attitudes by pairing a brand with affectively laden stimuli such as celebrity endorsers or pleasant pictures is called evaluative conditioning. We show that this attitude change can occur in two ways, depending on how brands and affective stimuli are presented. Attitude change can result from establishing a memory link between brand and affective stimulus (indirect attitude change) or from direct “affect transfer” from affective stimulus to brand (direct attitude change). Direct attitude change is significantly more robust than indirect attitude change, for example, to changes in the valence of affective stimuli (unconditioned stimulus revaluation: e.g., endorsers falling from grace), to interference by subsequent information (e.g., advertising clutter), and to persuasion knowledge activation (e.g., consumer suspicion about being influenced). Indirect evaluative conditioning requires repeated presentations of a brand with the same affective stimulus. Direct evaluative conditioning requires simultaneous presentation of a brand with different affective stimuli.

In the crude analysis it gives the closed-form estimator of the risk ration and the large-sample variance estimator of its logarithm. Although the previously proposed crude risk ratio estimator generally retains high efficiency, its asymptotic efficiency relative to the new estimator falls below .9 in some parameter combinations. The efficient score test of zero exposure effect is shown to be identical with the chi-square test proposed by Miettinene (1982, Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Heath 8, supplement 1, 7-14). In the stratified analysis, maximum likelihood estimation of the common risk ratio and the standardization methods based on stratum-specific maximum likelihood estimators are given.

Hartley	Journal of Ecology	95	3	2007-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 414-424	British Ecological Society	fla		1 The resource availability hypothesis (RAH) predicts that allocation of resources to anti-herbivore defences differs between species according to their growth rate. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the growth and defence investment strategies of 18 grass species and comparing them against vole feeding preferences. In addition, we assessed the effectiveness of silica, the primary defence in many grasses, in influencing vole feeding behaviour. 2 Across species, we found that there was a strong negative relationship between the overall investment in defence and growth rate, thus supporting predictions of the RAH. However, no such relationship was found when assessing the various individual anti-herbivore defences, suggesting that different grass species show significant variation in their relative investment in strategies such as phenolic concentration, silica concentration and leaf toughness. 3 Silica was the most influential defensive factor in determining vole feeding preference. Experimentally induced increases in leaf silica concentration deterred vole feeding in three of the five species tested, and altered feeding preference ranks between species. The strong positive relationship between silica concentration and leaf abrasiveness, when assessed both within and between species, suggests that increased abrasiveness is the mechanism by which silica deters feeding. 4 Although grasses are often considered to be tolerant of herbivore damage rather then defended against it, they do follow predictions of defence allocation strategy based on their growth rates, and this affects the feeding behaviour of generalist grass-feeding herbivores.

Design Factorial randomised controlled single blind trial of treatment leaflet, drug counselling, both, or treatment as usual. Setting Primary care in Wessex Participants 250 patients starting treatment with tricyclic antidepressants. Main outcome measures Adherence to drug treatment (by confidential self report and electronic monitor); depressive symptoms and health status. Results 66 (63%) patients continued with drugs to 12 weeks in the counselled group compared with 42 (39%) of those who did not receiving counselling (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 4.8; number needed to treat = 4). Treatment leaflets had no significant effect on adherence. No differences in depressive symptoms were found between treatment groups overall, although a significant improvement was found in patients with major depressive disorder receiving drug doses of at least 75 mg (depression score 4 (SD 3.7) counselling v 5.9 (SD 5.0) no counselling, P = 0.038). Conclusions Counselling about drug treatment significantly improved adherence, but clinical benefit was seen only in patients with major depressive disorder receiving doses ≥75 mg. Further research is required to evaluate the effect of this approach in combination with appropriate targeting of treatment and advice about dosage.

Locations included Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, the Nueces River Delta, and Mustang Island. Few significant differences existed in invertebrate density or biomass between sites; greater differences were found seasonally than between natural and created sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of avian abundance separated Mustang Island from Nueces Delta. Cluster analysis of behavior of Black-bellied Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), "peeps" (Calidris minutilla, C. pusilla), and Willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), showed no clear differences in their behavior on natural and created sites. Mustang Island sites were more similar to each other than to Nueces Delta. All created sites had natural hydrology and tidal circulation, which appear to facilitate invertebrate and avian recruitment.

Social support is one factor related to HRQOL that may contribute to the observed gender difference. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with HRQOL, especially levels of social support, and variation by gender. Methods Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze data from 4,498 men and 6,948 women participating in an ongoing community-based cohort study in Washington County, Maryland (CLUE-II). Results The results showed that men reported significantly better HRQOL than women. Men reported having higher levels of social support than women, but the magnitude of the association with HRQOL was similar. Having two or less close friends was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of reporting poorer HRQOL compared to having 10 or more close friends among both genders (men: OR = 1.49; women: OR = 1.53). Differences in the level of social support did not explain the gender difference in HRQOL. Conclusions Our findings show that social support is an important correlate of HRQOL for both men and women. However, the gender differences in HRQOL are not explained by social support or the other factors examined.

Poole	Irish Journal of Agricultural Research	28	1	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 11-23	TEAGASC-Agriculture and Food Development Authority	fla		Three experiments studied the effects of increasing rates of sulphuric acid application on silage composition and intake, and on animal performance and copper status. Herbage was direct-cut from permanent grass swards. In Experiments 1 and 2 the herbage was ensiled untreated or following treatment with formic acid (850 g kg⁻¹) at 3.0 l t⁻¹ or sulphuric acid (450 g kg⁻¹) at 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 or 6.0 l t⁻¹. Individual intakes of steers offered the silages were recorded. In Experiment 3, three successive cuts of grass were ensiled following treatment with formic acid at 2.3 l t⁻¹ or sulphuric acid at 2.3 or 4.2 l t⁻¹. The three cuts in each preservative treatment were offered in sequence, with or without 2.39 kg concentrates per head daily, to finishing heifers for 191 days. All silages were well-preserved in Experiments 1 and 2 (pH and NH₃-N values less than 4.2 and 71 g kg⁻¹ total N, respectively). The addition of increasing rates of sulphuric acid had relatively little effect on preservation characteristics. There was no consistent effect of acid type or application rate on preservation characteristics in Experiment 3. Silage dry matter (DM) intakes in Experiments 1 and 2 averaged 19.9 and 21.6 g kg⁻¹ liveweight, respectively, and there was no significant effect of treatment. Intake and liveweight gain were not affected by preservative treatment in Experiment 3, but concentrate supplementation reduced silage DM intake (6.08 to 5.05 kg day⁻¹) and increased (p < 0.001) daily liveweight gain (499 to 759 g). There was no interaction between preservative treatment and supplementation. Sulphuric acid treatments were generally associated with reduced liver and blood Cu levels particularly at the higher rates of addition. Supplementation with concentrates had a positive effect on Cu status. It is concluded that increasing the application rate of sulphuric acid above 2.3-3.0 l t⁻¹ had no significant effect on intake or animal performance, but did tend to reduce the animals' Cu status.

Grierson	New Phytologist	186	4	2010-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 947-956	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		Rhizanthella gardneri is a rare and fully subterranean orchid that is presumably obligately mycoheterotrophic. R. gardneri is thought to be linked via a common mycorrhizal fungus to co-occurring autotrophic shrubs, but there is no experimental evidence to support this supposition. We used compartmentalized microcosms to investigate the R. gardneri tripartite relationship.¹³CO₂ was applied to foliage of Melaleuca scalena plants and [¹³C-¹⁵ N]glycine was fed to the common mycorrhizal fungus, and both sources traced to R. gardneri plants. In our microcosm trial, up to 5% of carbon (C) fed as ¹³CO₂ to the autotrophic shrub was transferred to R. gardneri. R. gardneri also readily acquired soil C and nitrogen (N), where up to 6.2% of C and 22.5% of N fed as labelled glycine to soil was transferred via the fungus to R. gardneri after 240 h. Our study confirms that R. gardneri is mycoheterotrophic and acquires nutrients via mycorrhizal fungus connections from an ectomycorrhizal autotrophic shrub and directly from the soil via the same fungus. This connection with a specific fungus is key to explaining why R. gardneri occurs exclusively under certain Melaleuca species at a very limited number of sites in Western Australia.

Ramos, Jane Memmott	Ecological Applications	20	5	2010-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1191-1203	Ecological Society of America	fla		Plant invasions are a key cause of biodiversity loss and motivate many restoration programs worldwide. We assessed restoration success of an invaded forest in the Azores using two complementary experimental designs: a before—after control—impact (BACI) design compared a restored and a control (unmanipulated) site over three years, while a control—impact (CI) design evaluated the short-term effects of restoration on restored—control replicated pairs. In both designs, a food web approach was used to evaluate both structural and functional aspects of the restoration. Two years after removing alien plants from the BACI design, there were increases in the abundance of native seeds (110%), herbivorous insects (85%), insect parasitoids (5%), and birds (7%) in the experimental plot compared to the unmanipulated plot. In the CI design, five experimental plots were weeded and paired with five adjacent unmanipulated plots. Immediately following the removal of alien plants within the experimental plots, there was a significant decrease in native plant species, likely attributed to the effect of disturbance. Nevertheless, the production of native seeds increased by 35% in year 1, and seed production of the focal endemic plant, Ilex perado (holly), increased 159% in year 2. Weeding increased the survivorship and growth of seedlings transplanted into the plots, particularly those of alien species. Both experiments provide evidence of the positive effects of weeding cascading through the food web from native plants to herbivorous insects, insect parasitoids, and birds. Two aspects that could prove critical to the outcome of restoration programs deserve further attention: most bird-dispersed seeds were alien, and weeding favored alien over native seedling growth.

It is however important that discussion on Pareto is always made from a critical and never an apologetic angle, as is often the case with the Paretian coterie. Mongardini has no escaped this vice. Pareto belonged to that culture, half Italian, half French, which played such a large part in the anti-positivistic polemics of the early twentieth century in Italy. Pareto's progress from Cavalottian populism to the anti-masses aristocraticism of the early years of this century is illustrated. On the basis of some observations by G. Busino, consideration is given to the statistical curve of distribution and on its supposed invariability. Invariability was used by its "discoverer" Pareto and many others in order to demonstrate the vacuity of "redistributive socialism". This "redistributive socialism" had tecently been revived by J. S. Mill and Thornton, and had become part of the baggage of those favourable to progressive taxation of income, begginning with E. Sax. Nevertheless, Pareto was convinced that socialism was a quaestio essentially tied to: "the fair distribution of income", including Marxism -- and in his anti-socialist polemics he ended by using the statistical "discovery" as an eminently useful new weapon with which to confute socialists of any sort or colour. And the Paretian "discovery" had, in fact, very great success.

Three patterns of group effects are hypothesized: (1) an inclusive pattern in which a president improves his popularity among a broad range of groups, including critics and backers, (2) a discordant pattern in which a president improves his standing with one group at the expense of another, and (3) an impassive pattern in which a president leaves unaffected groups who are not already supportive. The findings reveal that relative to the influences of inflation, unemployment, national events, inaugurations, and military involvement, each president except Nixon achieves inclusive non-partisan approval gains by delivering a major national address. Discordant and impassive patterns are observed for Nixon, who antagonizes Democrats with his speeches, but leaves unaffected Republicans and Independents. In relatively inclusive ways, the speeches of each of the other four presidents also boost support among middle- and upper-income people. Ironically, Reagan alone gains increased approval from low-income individuals. Nixon's speeches produce discordant results by increasing his support among those with high incomes, while decreasing approval of those with low incomes.

Cole	Evolution	55	2	2001-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 324-329	Society for the Study of Evolution	fla		Mating success in the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, increases with male size. We tested the hypothesis that increased mating success increases male fitness and the fitness of colonies that make large males by comparing the sperm content of males prior to and at the conclusion of the mating swarm. The number of sperm a male initially possesses is a function of male size, and large males transfer a greater proportion of their sperm than do small males. For colonies, the payoff per unit of investment is an increasing function of male size, and investment in large males is not equivalent to investing in a larger number of small males. Allocation ratios in species that show size variation in reproductives may need to be modified by the individual fitness functions.

Webster, Payne, and Pagel (2003, Science 301:478) introduced a statistical procedure (the "delta" test) to detect this artifact, and here we report the results of computer simulations that examine the test's performance. In a sample of 50,000 random data sets, we find that the delta test detects the artifact in 94.4% of cases in which it is present. When the artifact is not present (n = 10,000 simulated data sets) the test showed a type I error rate of approximately 1.69%, incorrectly reporting the artifact in 169 data sets. Three measures of tree shape or "balance" failed to predict the size of the node-density effect. This may reflect the relative homogeneity of our randomly generated topologies, but emphasizes that nearly any topology can suffer from the artifact, the effect not being confined only to highly unevenly sampled or otherwise imbalanced trees. The ability to screen phylogenies for the node-density artifact is important for phylogenetic inference and for researchers using phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary processes, including their use in molecular clock dating.

McGrath, Keith Olsen, Robert J. Pabst	Ecological Applications	17	1	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 48-65	Ecological Society of America	fla		We used spatial simulation models to evaluate how current and two alternative policies might affect potential biodiversity over 100 years in the Coast Ranges Physiographic Province of Oregon. This 2.3-million-ha province is characterized by a diversity of public and private forest owners, and a wide range of forest policy and management objectives. We evaluated habitat availability for seven focal species representing different life histories. We also examined how policies affected old-growth stand structure, age distributions relative to the historical range of variability, and landscape patterns of forest types. Under the current policy scenario, the area of habitat for old-growth forest structure and associated species increased over time, the habitat for some early-successional associates remained stable, and the area of hardwood vegetation and diverse early-successional stages declined. The province is projected to move toward but not reach the historical range of variation of forest age classes that may have occurred under the wildfire regimes of the pre-Euroamerican settlement period. Ownership explained much of the pattern of biodiversity in the province, and under the current policy scenario, its effect increased over time as the landscape diverged into highly contrasting forest structures and ages. Patch type diversity declined slightly overall but declined strongly within ownerships. Most of the modeled change in biodiversity over time resulted from policies on public forest lands that were intended to increase the area of late-successional forests and species. One of the alternative policies, increased retention of wildlife trees on private lands, reduced the contrast between ownerships and increased habitat availability over time for both early-and late-successional species. Analysis of another alternative, stopping thinning of plantations on federal lands, indicated that current thinning regimes improve habitat for the Olive-sided Flycatcher, but the no-thinning alternative had no effect on the habitat scores for the latesuccessional species in the 100-year simulation. A comparison of indicators of biological diversity suggests that using focal species and forest structural measures can provide complementary information on biodiversity. The multi-ownership perspective provided a more complete synthesis of province-wide biodiversity patterns than assessments based on single ownerships.

Series B, Human Geography	94	3	2012-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 207-221	Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, Wiley	fla		Place is a central concept in geographical thought. Though places continue to play an important role as a scale and site of research, place is not widely used as a method of analysis. Doreen Massey's efforts to conceive of, first, a global and then a relational sense of place provide the foundation for such an analytic frame. However, she does not provide a research methodology. This study has two goals; the first is to provide a methodology for the application of a relational sense of place in field research. I develop that methodology through a review of Massey's epistemology of place. In accord with Massey's concerns with the imposition of more global perspectives, the proposed methodology prioritizes a weak theory perspective and balances deduction with induction. I then provide a case example of this methodology through research into labour relationships negotiated by people in a specific place, Jolly Beach in Antigua, West Indies. My second goal is to demonstrate that the particularistic findings produced through that research can contribute uniquely and critically to geographic knowledge and theory. The findings produced by this research bear importantly on a number of propositions in the current literature, including but not limited to what has been called new work, enclave economies, gendered performativity of labour, and tourist—worker dialectics in the Anglophone Caribbean. These specific findings are of interest, but are not limited to tourism studies.

Pearce	Arctic	44		1991-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 49-57	Arctic Institute of North America	fla		SPOT satellite data were used to detect and map muskox habitat on Devon Island, N. W. T. Muskox habitat in the Canadian High Arctic is restricted to small islands of productive sedge meadow isolated within a matrix of sparsely vegetated polar desert. On Devon Island, muskox herds move among small lowlands on the northeast coast adjacent to Jones Sound in response to the seasonal availability of sedge-dominated habitat. Comparisons between the enhanced satellite images and species composition, plant cover, and standing crop on these lowlands showed that sedge meadows were spectrally distinct from the dwarf shrub/heath and cushion plant/lichen-moss cover types on beach ridges and rock outcrops, indicating that spectral data can be used to identify critical forage habitat for muskoxen in the High Arctic. The hummocky sedge/moss meadow and the less productive frost boil sedge/moss meadow types could be separated from each other on the enhanced imagery. The satellite data were simplified using a supervised classification to document the type and areal cover of muskox habitat along the northeast coast of Devon Island. The spatially isolated hummocky sedge/moss and frost boil sedge/moss meadows occupied only 3% (16.73 km²) and 6% (32.84 km² ) respectively of a total land area of 549.38 km². /// Des données du satellite Spot ont été utilisées pour détecter et cartographier l'habitat du boeuf musqué dans l'île Devon (Territoires du Nord-Ouest). L'habitat du boeuf musqué dans Ã Extrême-Arctique canadien est restreint à de petites îles de prairies à laîches isolées sur un fond de désert polaire à la végétation clairsemée. Sur l'île Devon, les troupeaux de boeufs musqués se déplacent sur un territoire limité de terres basses sur la côte nord-est adjacente à Jones Sound, en réponse à la disponibilité saisonnière de l'habitat où dominent les laîches. Des comparaisons entre les images satellites accentuées et la composition des espèces, le couvert végétal ainsi que les plantes sur pied dans ces terres basses, ont révélé que les prairies à laîches avaient un spectre distinct des types de couvert à buissons nains/bruyère et de plantes coussinées/lichens-mousses sur les rides de plage et les affleurements rocheux, ce qui montre que les données spectrales peuvent servir à identifier un habitat de pâturage critique pour le boeuf musqué dans Ã Extrême-Arctique. Sur l'image accentuée, on a pu distinguer le genre prairie à laîches/prairie de mousse avec creux et bosses, des types moins productifs, prairie à laîches/prairie de mousse avec boursouflements. Les données satellites ont été simplifiées à l'aide d'une classification dirigée pour documenter le genre et la superficie de l'habitat du boeuf musqué le long de la côte nord-est de l'île Devon. Les prairies à laîches/prairies de mousse avec creux et bosses et les prairies à laîches/prairies de mousse avec boursouflements, prairies spatialement isolées n'occupaient respectivement que 3 p. cent (16,73 km² ) et 6 p. cent (32,84 km²) sur une superficie terrestre totale de 549,38 km².

In recent years, statistics on the family have recorded a steady increase in the divorce rate, a decline in both the marriage and birth rates, and a rising proportion of premarital births to total births. These trends translate into family structures in which an increasing proportion of children are members of single-parent families. Although not inevitable, on balance some harmful spillover effects are probably generated such as less attractive human personal qualities, declining domestic tranquility in the community, and decreasing individual capability for educational achievement, work accomplishment, and earning power. After this second run through of social indicators, there seems to be sufficient evidence that, while the work was conducted by very competent people, the operational structure is far from optimal for achieving sustained progress in this field. Producing social indicators requires more than a process of searching and soliciting statistical tables from the statistical networks, assembling them in packages of charts, tables, and texts and marketing them in attractive publications. In the end it may come down to the fact that insufficient resources have been committed to these social indicator projects, precluding the formation of proper operational goals, rather than concluding that social indicator efforts are bereft of potential.

Based on these preliminary findings, we analyzed an additional 1825 larvae from Clearwater collections in 2007, 2008, and 2009 to investigate the reproductive statuses of the two prevalent taxa of the complex there and to determine whether cytogenetic diversity and frequency of types were similar from year to year. We describe a cytotype new to science and a potentially derivative cytotype of S. arcticum sensu stricto. We also determine that these two taxa are present in similar frequencies from year to year and are in genetic equilibrium, suggesting that they are not reproductively isolated. This study constitutes the fourth positive test of our Geographic Distribution/Taxon Age hypothesis.

Because glutathione (GSH) is lower in sepsis, the hypothesis that GSH depletion might impair the migratory response of neutrophils to infection was tested. In a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture, GSH depletion inhibited peritoneal neutrophil infiltration, increased bacterial colonies, augmented pulmonary neutrophil infiltrate, and worsened survival. The reduced peritoneal influx of neutrophils was explained by a reduced in vivo neutrophil migration in response to locally administered chemokines and by reduced chemotactic activity and chemokine levels in peritoneal lavage fluid. Conversely, the GSH precursor N-acetyl-L-cysteine augmented neutrophil infiltration in the peritoneum but not in the lung, decreased bacterial colonies, and improved survival. Thus, migration of neutrophils to a site of infection and to a distant site is differently regulated, and optimal GSH levels are important for an efficient response to sepsis.

This upscaling is done for perforated/strongly heterogeneous domains. To the best knowledge of the authors, this seems to be the first attempt of upscaling the Cahn-Hilliard equation in such domains. The new homogenized equation should have a broad range of applicability owing to the well-known versatility of phase-field models. The additionally introduced feature of systematically and reliably accounting for confined geometries by homogenization allows for new modelling and numerical perspectives in both science and engineering. Our results are applied to wetting dynamics in porous media and to a single channel with strongly heterogeneous walls.

Douglass	Public Health Reports (1974-)	110	5	1995-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 522-530	Association of Schools of Public Health	fla		THE ERRONEOUS CLAIM that 50 percent of U.S. schoolchildren have never had a cavity has taken on the virtues of truth through frequent and widespread restatement. The 50-percent caries-free statement is an excessively optimistic misrepresentation by the media of the 1986-87 survey of oral health among schoolchildren by the National Institute of Dental Research because it only tells part of the story--it ignores dental disease in the primary dentition. This article documents that numerous public policy papers reflect failure to consider primary tooth caries data. Consequently, a significant disease burden has been overlooked. The article reviews the persistent underreporting of children's caries experience in policy documents and the dental literature, and reviews additional epidemiologic studies of caries reported in U.S. dental literature since 1985. Dental caries remains the single most common disease of childhood that is not self-limiting or amenable to a course of antibiotics. The popular statement that half of U.S. schoolchildren have never experienced tooth decay fails profoundly to reflect the extremity and severity of this still highly prevalent condition of childhood. At a time of extreme pressure on the Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment budget this uncritically held belief is leading to inappropriate policy and funding decisions that can put the health of children at risk.

The megadalton-sized spliceosome is composed of four small nuclear RNPs and additional pre-mRNA splicing factors. The formation of an active spliceosome involves a series of regulated steps that requires the assembly and disassembly of large multiprotein/RNA complexes. The dynamic nature of the pre-mRNA splicing reaction has hampered progress in analyzing the structure of spliceosomal complexes. We have used cryo-electron microscopy to produce a 29-Å density map of a stable 37S spliceosomal complex from the genetically tractable fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Containing the U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs, pre-mRNA splicing intermediates, U2 and U5 snRNP proteins, the Nineteen Complex (NTC), and second-step splicing factors, this complex closely resembles in vitro purified mammalian C complex. The density map reveals an asymmetric particle, ≈30 × 20 × 18 nm in size, which is composed of distinct domains that contact each other at the center of the complex.

Using a model of the political decision-making process, the three variables were arranged in a 2× 2× 2 design with 6 male and 6 female dyads in each cell. Conflict of interest, in which the resources could be distributed only to one party's positions, resulted in less money allocated and in perceptions of the situation as more of a win-lose competition, of compromise as more like defeat, and of the greater importance of coming out favorably, than did conflict in which the resources could be distributed between the competing positions. Formal assignment of conflict positions resulted in less money allocated, and longer negotiations, than self-design of conflict positions. An explicit link between competing conflict positions and an ideological dissensus impeded conflict resolution for males, but not for females. The latter two inhibiting influences on conflict resolution were considered aspects of representation.

Göpel, Lena Eliasson, Patrik Rorsman	Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences	366	1880	2008-10-13T00:00:00Z	pp. 3503-3523	The Royal Society	fla		The perforated whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was applied to functionally identified β-cells in intact mouse pancreatic islets to study the extent of cell coupling between adjacent β-cells. Using a combination of current- and voltage-clamp recordings, the total gap junctional conductance between β-cells in an islet was estimated to be 1.22 nS. The analysis of the current waveforms in a voltage-clamped cell (due to the firing of an action potential in a neighbouring cell) suggested that the gap junctional conductance between a pair of β-cells was 0.17 nS. Subthreshold voltage-clamp depolarization (to -55 mV) gave rise to a slow capacitive current indicative of coupling between β-cells, but not in non-β-cells, with a time constant of 13.5 ms and a total charge movement of 0.2 pC. Our data suggest that a superficial β-cell in an islet is in electrical contact with six to seven other β-cells. No evidence for dye coupling was obtained when cells were dialysed with Lucifer yellow even when electrical coupling was apparent. The correction of the measured resting conductance for the contribution of the gap junctional conductance indicated that the whole-cell ${\rm K}_{{\rm ATP}}$ channel conductance $(G_{{\rm K},{\rm ATP}})$ falls from approximately 2.5 nS in the absence of glucose to 0.1 nS at 15 mM glucose with an estimated IC₅₀ of approximately 4 mM. Theoretical considerations indicate that the coupling between β-cells within the islet is sufficient to allow propagation of $[{\rm Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ waves to spread with a speed of approximately 80 μm s⁻¹, similar to that observed experimentally in confocal $[{\rm Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$ imaging.

Dierenfeld, Freeland Dunker	Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine	40	4	2009-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 632-638	American Association of Zoo Veterinarians	fla		Serum and whole blood samples from 64 clinically normal captive black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), aged 6 mo to 32 yr, were analyzed to survey mineral and fat-soluble vitamin concentrations. All animals were fed a commercial primate food and a wide range of fruits and vegetables. Specific commercial diet information was available for 52 animals that were fed one of 10 different diets. Data analysis showed no differences in the analytes attributable to sex or access to natural ultraviolet light. Serum phosphorus (range: 1.4–3.1 mmol/L) was significantly higher and retinol (range: 0.38–1.23 μmol/L) was significantly lower in young animals (≤4 yr). Iron (range: 17.2–77.0 μmol/L) and copper (range: 10.7–53.3 μmol/L) were much higher than concentrations reported in other free-ranging lemur species, and in some animals were at levels considered potentially toxic in domestic animals. Magnesium (range: 0.66–2.04 mmol/L), sodium (range: 111–201 mmol/L), and potassium (range: 2.0–6.8 mmol/L) ranged both lower and higher than concentrations considered adequate for a mammal, but were similar to concentrations reported in wild red ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra), a closely related species. Selenium (range: 3.5–7.7 μmol/L) was within the range expected for a mammal, but higher than concentrations reported in wild V. rubra. Zinc (range: 9.2–62.7 μmol/L) was similar to concentrations reported in V. rubra. Calcidiol (range: &lt;12.5–144.8 nmol/L) and retinol (range: 0.38–2.95 μmol/L) were both lower and higher than concentrations reported in V. rubra. Lower serum calcidiol concentration correlated with lower commercial dictary vitamin D3, α-tocopherol (range: 1.2 17.6 μmol/L) and γ-tocopherol (range: 0.3–3.9 μmol/L) were within a range expected in a captive frugivorous primate but higher than concentrations found in wild V. rubra.

Afonso, Myriam Abel, Helene Walter, Woreka Mera, Paul M. V. Martin, Eliane Chungue, Antoine Gessain	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	196	4	2007-08-15T00:00:00Z	pp. 510-521	Oxford University Press	fla		Background. Melanesia is endemic for human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) subtype C. In 2005, we identified 4 infected women from Ambae Island, Vanuatu. Subsequently, 4247 Ni-Vanuatu originating from 18 islands were enrolled to define HTLV-1 epidemiological determinants and to characterize the viral strains molecularly. Methods. Plasma from 1074 males and 3173 females were screened for HTLV-1/2 antibodies by particle agglutination (PA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Positive and/or borderline samples were then tested by a Western blot (WB) confirmatory assay. DNAs were amplified to obtain a 522-bp env gene fragment. Phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses were performed. Results. Of 4247 samples, 762 were positive and/or borderline by IFA/PA, and 26 of them were confirmed to be HTLV-1 positive by WB. The overall HTLV-1 seroprevalence was 0.62%. Viral transmission was found within families of infected index case patients. A geographic heterogeneity of HTLV-1 seroprevalence was observed among the islands. All 41 of the new env sequences belonged to HTLV-1 subtype C. Phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses suggested that Ni-Vanuatu and Solomon Islander strains emerged from a common ancestor ~10,000 years ago. Conclusion. The Vanuatu archipelago is endemic for HTLV-1 with a diversity of subtype C variants. These strains were probably introduced into Vanuatu during ancient migration of the original settlers a few thousand years ago.

Galloway	American Journal of Botany	95	1	2008-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 59-65	Botanical Society of America	fla		Phenotypic plasticity allows plants to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Environmental variation among populations may select for differentiation in plasticity. To test this idea, we used the annual plant Geranium carolinianum, which inhabits old fields that are densely vegetated and lack canopy cover and wood margins with tree shade but less neighbor shade. Individuals from three populations of each habitat were planted in natural low and high light environments, and morphological traits important for light acquisition were measured. Old-field plants were more plastic, with greater elongation of petioles and internodes in low light than those from wood margins. This larger shade avoidance response suggests evolution of greater plasticity to neighbor shade than to the tree canopy. Fitness of old-field plants was high across both light environments, whereas fitness of wood-margin plants was reduced in low light. Selection favored longer internodes in low than high light. Finally, plasticity for internode length was negatively associated with fitness in high light, suggesting a cost of plasticity for this trait. Together these results indicate that shadeavoidance plasticity of petiole and internode length is adaptive. However, greater elongation of internode length may be constrained by the cost of plasticity expressed in high light. The evolution of plasticity appears to reflect a balance between its adaptive nature and its cost to fitness.

The buyer sells a seasonal product over a short selling period and its inventory is subject to deterioration at a constant rate over time. The vendor's production rate is dependent on the buyer's demand rate, which is a linear function of time. Also, the vendor's production process is not perfectly reliable; it may shift from an in-control state to an out-of-control state at any time during a production run and produce some defective (non-conforming) items. Assuming that the vendor follows a lot-for-lot policy for replenishment made to the buyer, the average total cost of the supply chain is derived and an algorithm for finding the optimal solution is developed. The numerical study shows that the supply chain coordination policy is more beneficial than those policies obtained separately from the buyer's and the vendor's perspectives.

The urban residential landscape of Puerto Ricans in an manufacturing town in the Midwest, Lorain Ohio is examined, contrasting the use of landscape markers and home and yard maintenance among Puerto Ricans and their non-Hispanic neighbors. The characteristics of approximately 300 homes and yards in one south Lorain neighborhood are examined using data from a city directory to establish the ethnicity of the residents of each home (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic). Significant differences between the two groups with respect to the use of landscape markers and home and yard maintenance were found. A "Puerto Rican yard-complex" is identified in Lorain which is characterized by religious yard shrines, well kept front yard flower gardens, potted plants, well maintained yards, and homes painted in pastel colors. El estudio intenta determinar si los puertoriqueños en los EEUU continental expresan su etnicidad mediante la apariencía externa de sus viviendas. El paisaje residencial de una vecindad de imigrantes puertoriqueños en un pueblo del medio-oeste de los EEUU, Lorain Ohio es examinado, comparando el uso de marcadores del paisaje y el mantenimiento de las casas y jardines residenciales entre los puertoriqueños y sus vecinos no-hispanicos. El análisis de los datos reveló diferencias significativas entre los dos grupos. Se identificó un "complejo puertoriqueño de jardin" que caracteriza sus casas y jardines en Lorain, lo cual comprende nichos religiosos, uso de mazetas para plantas, jardines de flores delanteros, jardines bien mantenidos, y el uso de colores claros (pastel) para sus casas.

The central component of Expedition is a knowledge-elicitation system that guides a linguistically naive bilingual speaker through the process of describing "L" in terms of its ecological, morphological, grammatical, lexical, and transfer information. Expedition also includes a module for converting the elicited information into the format expected by the underlying MT system and an MT engine that relies on both the elicited knowledge and resident knowledge about English. The Expedition environment is integrated using a configuration and control system. Expedition represents an innovative approach to answering the need for rapid-configuration MT by preparing an MT system in which the only missing link is information about "L", which is elicited in a structured fashion such that it can be directly exploited by the system. In this paper we report on the current state of Expedition with an emphasis on the knowledge elicitation system.

Camacho	Journal of Orthoptera Research	19	2	2010-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 197-203	Orthopterists' Society	fla		We analyse here three components of reproductive success (egg fertility, egg clutch size and embryo clutch size) in several temporal samples from different Spanish and Moroccan populations of the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans. The analysis of spatial and temporal variation suggests that egg clutch size, but neither embryo clutch size nor egg fertility, depends significantly on both year of sampling and population of origin. While the former effect could mainly be due to year-to-year variation in food availability (essential to egg production but not to hatching success), the spatial variation may also include population-dependent genetic factors. We also tested the effect of the presence of supernumerary (B) chromosomes carried by many individuals in most natural populations of this species. We found a slight but significant decrease in egg fertility associated with the presence of B chromosomes. We discuss possible causes of the observed variation for these three reproductive traits at both spatial and temporal levels, as well as the effect of B-chromosome presence as a parasitic element disturbing reproduction of carrier females.

Using data from interviews conducted in 1957 with state legislators in four states and original data on the interviewees' subsequent political careers we find: (1) that lawyers move from the state legislature to other offices at a much greater rate than nonlawyers and that the difference is the result of their ability to advance to "lawyers-only" positions; (2) that a major reason for the "overrepresentation" of lawyers in American state legislatures is that legislative service has a greater political career value for lawyers than for nonlawyers; (3) that lawyers who move from the state legislature to a "lawyers-only" position tend to stay there; (4) that lawyers do not invest appreciably more time in their political careers than nonlawyers; but (5) lawyers are much more likely than nonlawyers to achieve their political career goals.

However, in some circumstances and jurisdictions, a third verdict option is available: Not Proven. The Not Proven verdict essentially reflects the view that the defendant is indeed culpable, but that the prosecution has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Like a Not Guilty verdict, the Not Proven verdict results in an acquittal. The main aim of the two studies reported here was to determine how, and under what circumstances, jurors opt to use the Not Proven verdict across different case types and when the strength of the evidence varies. In both studies, jurors were more likely to choose a Not Proven verdict over a Not Guilty verdict when the alternative was available. When evidence against the defendant was only moderately strong and a Not Proven verdict option was available (Study 2), there was also a significant reduction in the conviction rate. Results also showed that understanding of the Not Proven verdict was poor, highlighting inadequacies in the nature of judicial instructions relating to this verdict.

Lomolino and colleagues have recently reviewed the island rule in mammals and other vertebrates, claiming it is a general pattern. They have portrayed our recent analysis as weakly supporting the island rule, seeing weakness in our use of what they considered to be inadequate size indices (skulls and teeth, rather than mass or body length) and in our use of large islands. They argue that size evolution on islands points to a bauplan-specific fundamental size. We aim to test the generality of the rule and the adequacy of some of the data used to support it. Location Insular environments worid-wide. Methods We collate and analyse data on skull sizes of carnivores and body masses of mammals in general to see whether there is a graded trend from dwarfism in large species to gigantism in smaller ones. Results The island rule is not supported with either the carnivore or the mammal data sets. Island area does not influence size change. Main conclusions Our results suggest that data recently advanced in support of the island rule are inadequate and that the island rule is not a general pattern for all mammals.

Risk associated with the actual activities is assessed by treating these activities as variations on the prototype activity. In appropriate circumstances, this approach offers savings in the time and effort spent on risk analysis, possibly at the expense of some detail. The approach was conceived to deal with a commercially sensitive industrial project; in this paper it is illustrated by means of three hypothetical examples, which demonstrate a wide range of potential applications.

In communicative interaction, one can identify different features that may increase the complexity of the dialogue structure.

From there, we proceed by looking at particular examples that justify either an enrichment or a restriction of the initial model.

Several distributed lag models are examined in order to discover a possible delayed mortality response. The results of those models with geometrically declining lag coefficients are consistent with those of the other lag models. Adjustment is made for serial correlation, and the consequences of measurement error are explored. Application of the various models to four to six different time periods allows an examination of the consistency of these models. Results for all time periods indicate associations between daily mortality and air pollution values. The distributed lag models suggest that any lagged effect is negligible in comparison with the immediate response.

Though in recent years increasing attention has been given towards the development of nuptiality models, not much work has been done in this field in India. An attempt has been made here to review the different marriage models and to apply them over Indian data. L'A., dopo aver passato in rassegna alcuni modelli di nuzialità, cerca di verificare l'applicabilità di alcuni di essi (modello Coale, modello Hernes e curve polinomiali) ai dati indiani. Dans cette étude on a passé en revue quelques modèles de nuptialité (modèle de Coale, modèle de Hernes et polynômes) et on les a appliqués à la situation de l'Inde. Comme la méthode de Coale ne fonctionne pas directement avec les données indiennes, un programme utilisant les moindres écarts absolus a été développé pour corriger le modèle original.

Phylogenetic analyses applying parsimony and distance estimates confirmed the monophyly of Balsaminaceae and suggest the monophyly of Impatiens. Within Impatiens, a few clades are recognized with strong support. Two of the most important clades are the spurless Madagascan endemic group, and the one comprising species with broadly fusiform fruits and the basic chromosome number x = 8, that shows a Southeast Asia, southern India, Africa, and Madagascar connection. Despite recognition of several strongly supported small lineages, ITS data alone could not resolve relationships among most of the lineages with confident support values. ITS phylogenies are therefore of limited taxonomic value for Impatiens. However, ITS phylogenies do reveal that extant Impatiens species are of Southeast Asian origin, from where dispersals to boreal Eurasia and North America, to central Asia and eastern Europe via the Himalayas, and to India and Africa have occurred. The Madagascan Impatiens show an African origin. Molecular phylogenies suggest the ancestral basic chromosome number to be x = 10, and the spurred flowers and elongated linear fruits to be plesiomorphic states in Impatiens. A predominantly descending dysploid chromosome evolution, following dispersal of the clade with broadly fusiform fruits from Southeast Asia to India, Africa, and Madagascar, is also suggested.

Here we consider a subclass of these processes in which the intensity is assumed to be a deterministic function of another nonexplosive marked point process. In particular, we will investigate an intensity jump process with an exponential decay having an analytic form for the distribution of the times and sizes of the jumps, which can be seen as a generalization of the classical shot noise process. Assuming that the intensity is unobservable, interest here is in its filtering, that is, in the computation of its conditional distribution, over a whole time interval, given an observed trajectory of realized events. Because, in general, this computation cannot be performed analytically, we propose a simulation method that provides an approximate solution, which relies on the reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Interestingly, the proposed filtering algorithm also allows the setup of a likelihood-based procedure for the estimation of the parameters of the model based on stochastic versions of the expectationn̵maximization (EM) algorithm. The potential of the filtering and estimation methods proposed are illustrated through some simulation experiments as well as on a financial ultra-high-frequency dataset of intraday S&amp;P500 futures prices.

Three groups were contrasted: a new game group (n = 22), who received a home video game system in December; an old game group (n = 25), who had owned a video game for a year; and a no game group (n = 17), who did not own a video game system. Children responded to questionnaires about their leisure activities, their school work, and their peer interactions, in both November and March. The new game children received an additional assessment in January, 3 weeks after first receiving their video game. Results showed that an initial high involvement with the video game soon dropped off. Early decreases in leisure activities (television, for example) also soon disappeared. School activities and peer involvement were not affected at any point. It is concluded that owning a video game does not greatly alter a child's activities.

Schnable	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	103	18	2006-05-02T00:00:00Z	pp. 6805-6810	National Academy of Sciences	fla		Heterosis is the phenomenon whereby the progeny of particular inbred lines have enhanced agronomic performance relative to both parents. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this fundamental biological phenomenon, the responsible molecular mechanisms have not been determined. The maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 produce a heterotic F₁ hybrid. Global patterns of gene expression were compared in seedlings of these three genotypes by using a microarray that contains 13,999 cDNAs. Using an estimated 15% false discovery rate as a cutoff, 1,367 ESTs (9.8%) were identified as being significantly differentially expressed among genotypes. All possible modes of gene action were observed, including additivity, high-and low-parent dominance, underdominance, and overdominance. The largest proportion of the ESTs (78%; 1,062 of 1,367) exhibited expression patterns that are not statistically distinguishable from additivity. Even so, 22% of the differentially regulated ESTs exhibited nonadditive modes of gene expression. Classified on the basis of significant pairwise comparisons of genotype means, 181 of these 305 nonadditive ESTs exhibited high-parent dominance and 23 exhibited lowparent dominance. In addition, 44 ESTs exhibited underdominance or overdominance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple molecular mechanisms, including overdominance, contribute to heterosis.

Here, we demonstrate that these sigma factors, both together and independently, regulate a much more extensive number of genes and cellular processes. Microarray analyses of σ 54 and σ  s mutant strains identified 305 genes regulated by σ 54 and 145 regulated by σ  s, whereas the σ 54-σ  s regulatory cascade appears to control 48 genes in B. burgdorferi. In silico analyses revealed that nearly 80% of genes with altered expression in the σ 54 mutant were linked to potential σ 54-dependent promoters. Many σ 54-regulated genes are expressed in vivo, and through genetic complementation of the mutant, we demonstrated that σ 54 was required by B. burgdorferi to infect mammals. Surprisingly, σ 54 mutants were able to infect Ixodes scapularis ticks and be maintained for at least 24 wk after infection, suggesting the σ 54-σ  s regulatory network was not involved in long-term survival in ticks. However, σ 54 mutants did not enter the salivary glands during tick feeding, indicating that σ 54-regulated genes were involved in the transmission process.

We construct an ideal typical model of Maoist insurgency that is used to compare the roles played by local populations, insurgents, and state counterinsurgency measures across space and time. This allows us to demonstrate that the commonly accepted narrative of Indian Maoist insurgency must be fundamentally rethought. The Naxalbari outbreak in 1967 and the subsequent insurgency in West Bengal is generally agreed to be the central point in the history of Maoist insurgency in India. But our analysis demonstrates that it was comparatively short-lived and atypical. We instead trace the genealogy of Indian Maoism to Telengana in the late 1940s. The common feature linking all three waves is the persistence of insurgent activity among various tribal or adivasi communities in the central Indian "tribal belt." Their overriding grievances are the historically iniquitous relationships produced by the processes of state and market expansion that have incorporated and subordinated adivasi populations who previously had a large degree of socioeconomic and political autonomy. The state's counterinsurgency strategy has consisted of violence combined with developmental and governance interventions. This has pushed Maoist insurgency to the margins of Indian political life but has been unable to eliminate insurgent activity or address the fundamental grievances of adivasis. We conclude by arguing that Maoist insurgency in India should not be considered as crime to be resolved by state violence, or as an economic problem requiring the intensification of developmental measures, but as a matter of politics.

Hwang	Journal of the American Statistical Association	81	395	1986-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 680-688	American Statistical Association	fla		In an errors-in-variables model, the predicting variables are observed with errors. Traditionally, the errors are assumed to be additive. In this article, I consider the case in which the error is multiplicative, a situation that arises when analyzing some recent data released by the U.S. Department of Energy. A consistent estimator  $\hat\beta$  is provided for regression coefficients β by correcting the asymptotic bias of the least squares estimate. It is shown that  $\hat\beta - \beta$ , after being normalized by an estimate of its covariance, is asymptotically normally distributed. This can, therefore, be used to construct approximate tests and confidence sets for β. The results are essentially nonparametric.

An example concerning kidney function of cadmium workers is discussed in detail. In that example, the treatment effect is far from additive: It is plausibly zero at the lower quartile of responses to control, and it is large and fairly insensitive to bias at the upper quartile.

Kuang, Peter Chesson	Ecology	90	1	2009-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 170-182	Ecological Society of America	fla		We investigate the effect of seed predation on the coexistence of competing annual plants. We demonstrate a role for predation that is opposite to the conventional wisdom that predation promotes coexistence by reducing the intensity of competition. In the common situation where competitive coexistence involves intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition, predation can undermine coexistence by reducing the overall magnitude of competition, replacing competition with "apparent competition" in a way that does not lead to differential intraspecific and interspecific effects. We demonstrate this outcome in the case where coexistence occurs by "the storage effect" in a variable environment. The storage effect arises when the environment interacts with competition to create opportunities for species to increase from low density. Critical to the storage effect is positive covariance between the response of population growth to the environment and its response to competition, when a species is at high density. This outcome prevents species at high density from taking advantage of favorable environmental conditions. A species at low density has lower covariance and can take advantage of favorable environmental conditions, giving it an advantage over a high-density species, fostering its recovery from low density. Hence, species coexistence is promoted. Here we find that density-dependent predation lowers population densities, and so weakens competition, replacing competition with apparent competition, which does not covary with the environment. As a consequence, covariance between environment and competition is weakened, reducing the advantage to a species at low density. The species still strongly interact through the combination of competition and apparent competition, but the reduced low-density advantage reduces their ability to coexist. Although this result is demonstrated specifically for the storage effect with a focus on annual plant communities, the principles involved are general ones.

We also consider how recent demographic shifts lead to new family arrangements that have implications for parenthood and well-being. These include stepparenting, parenting of grandchildren, and childlessness across the life course.

Incorporating Hill and Leighley's measure of liberal party control, we offer a framework that places party elites as an important component in the state electoral setting. However, this effort departs from previous work by suggesting that studies of voter mobilization should pay greater attention to participation as a multi-stage process, where citizens must first register. Our results conform to expectations driven by this conceptualization. States with more liberal Democratic elites and more Democratic legislatures witness higher levels of registration, controlling for other factors. We find that the influence of liberal party control on state turnout is indirect, operating through registration. Our results are consistent with a view of party elite ideology as a long-term, rather than campaign-specific, component of state electoral politics. More generally, the analyses provide new insight into influences on aggregate registration and turnout and into the electoral participation across the United States of different income classes.

Dunnell	American Journal of Archaeology	88	4	1984-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 489-513	Archaeological Institute of America	fla		In contrast with the consolidating character of the Americanist archaeological literature of recent years, the literature for 1983 contains both shifts in emphasis and emerging challenges to the theoretical position that has dominated the past two decades. The outcome of these changes is by no means settled, but Americanist archaeology is nevertheless more diverse than it has been for many years. Substantive contributions remain conservative and largely within the culture historical framework. The dominance of lithic and faunal studies in their respective domains is giving way to innovative work in ceramic analysis and paleoethnobotanical studies. Cultural resource management (CRM) continues to be the center of debate, but in 1983 theoretical challenges of wide potential impact have been added to the more pragmatic considerations of past years. A brief examination of historical archaeology, only recently drawn within the Americanist approach, shows it to reflect the main themes and problems of the larger disciplines. Only in the area of field techniques is development apparently linear and progressive. The most important development, however, is the continued appearance of non-materialist, non-scientific interpretive models, particularly those that can be loosely termed "symbolic approaches." These approaches are in direct opposition to the basic tenets of the new archaeology that have served as the theoretical core of Americanist archaeology for two decades. The rise of alternative approaches is seen as a direct consequence of the failure of the new archaeology to develop theoretical tools for assigning meaning to archaeological phenomena in a way that is consistent with its materialistic underpinnings.

The results indicate that corporate ownership and market contexts matter in determining the quality of information offered in political news coverage.

Despite considerable attention to connections between globalization and policy efficacy, no research explores connections between the world economy and confidence in politicians. This article makes three novel arguments. First, by constraining administrative control over policy outcomes, economic globalization reduces levels of public confidence in national executives. Second, by signaling a more complex policy-making environment, exposure to world markets increases the volatility of policy maker evaluations. And third, economic openness affects public preferences over policy by shifting policy demands-away from domains constrained by market liberalization and toward areas where national autonomy remains strong. Time-series analyses of public opinion data from France support research expectations. As the first study to link economic globalization to policy perceptions, this article finds that the political consequences of engaging the global economy are more numerous than previously implied.

Our findings suggest significant network and homophily effects regarding the status and age of artists at fairs. However, the internationality of fairs and geographic distances between them do not seem to have any effect.

Thompson	Ecology	75	5	1994-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1420-1428	Ecological Society of America	fla		Recent optimality models of host-parasitoid associations have assumed that host quality varies with host size or age at parasitism. This is based on the fact that larger hosts provide more resources, making size a reliable indicator of the amount of resources available for parasitoid development. Few studies have examined this is parasitoids that allow their hosts to continue development after parasitism (koinobiont parasitoids). In this study we compared growth trajectories of the koinobiont ichneumonid endoparasitoid Venturia canescens developing in four larval instars of one of its host, the moth Plodia interpunctella. Hosts were reared with excess food and parasitized as late second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Hosts were dissected at intervals after parasitism, and host and parasitoid dry mass determined. The survivorship, development time, and size of eclosing adult wasp were also monitored. Hosts parasitized by Venturia continued to grow and become prepupae, although their maximum masses were progressively smaller the earlier that the hosts were parasitized: second-instar (L2) hosts grew to 70% of control (unparasitized) size, while L4 and L5 hosts reached control size. The maximum larval dry mass, as well as eclosing adult size, varied with host instar at parasitism. Venturia larvae spent prolonged periods as first instars when developing from L2 hosts and grew most rapidly during early stages in L5 larvae.The data show that for Venturia, host quality is not a direct function of host at parasitism. Furthermore, the pattern of development shown by Venturia differs markedly from that shown by aphidiid koinobiont parasitoids.

Few studies, however, have been able to directly capture processes involved. In this article, we draw on unique qualitative and quantitative data pertaining to verified cases of workplace sex and race discrimination (1988 to 2003), and analyze the discriminatory experiences of African-American and white women across various occupational statuses. Notable are high levels of discriminatory firing for both groups, but higher instances of race-based promotional discrimination for black women--a pattern partially linked to their disparate concentration in sex-segregated workplaces and in positions of lower occupational prestige. Our qualitative immersion into case materials reveals influential mechanisms and employer justifications, unique manifestations of differential treatment on the job, and the use of "soft skill" criteria in gatekeeper decision making. We conclude by discussing important dimensions of workplace discrimination for women, variations by social class and race status, and how complexities of status matter for what women experience and gatekeeper behavior.

The quality circles programs that exist in many Japanese organizations are being widely adopted in U.S. organizations. However, the high expectations and lack of planned evaluation for the quality circle programs in many U.S. organizations suggests that quality circles are already in the adoption-disappointment-discontinuation cycle that has been characteristic of many other managerial fads. The authors present several reasons why qualify circles can lead to increases in the morale, motivation, productivity, and work quality of workers and suggest that the conventional wisdom, which sees them as either a form of job enrichment or a human relations technique, is ill-focused. The types of organizational settings in which quality circles are most likely to be effective are discussed and suggestions are made regarding the proper evaluation of quality circle programs.

COULSON, IAN BOOMER	Geografiska Annaler. Series A, Physical Geography	93	2	2011-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 71-88	Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, Wiley	fla		Flutes are widespread across the forefield of a polythermal valley glacier Midre Lovénbreen, Svalbard, where they consistently form on the downglacier face of cobble to bouldersized subglacially-transported clasts ploughed into proglacial till. The width of flutes at Midre Lovénbreen is constant along their long-axes and proportional to the size of their associated subglacially-transported boulders. Frozen flutes are observed subglacially where they protrude into the debris-rich basal ice layer of the glacier. Particlesize analysis shows that flutes are depleted in gravel-sized particles relative to adjacent subglacial till. Ice sampled from flutes is enriched in δ¹ɸO relative to overlying glacier ice and debris-rich basal ice. These properties are interpreted to reflect the formation of flutes by the squeezing of till into basal cavities associated with boulders beneath warm-based ice in the interior of the glacier. It is hypothesized that localized freeze-on of flute sediments, within a broader zone of warm-based ice, occurs within cavities due to either (i) a 'heat-pump' effect operating across these boulders leading to the development of a cold patch within the cavity, and/or (ii) fluctuations in cavity length caused by slip-stick glacial motion. Once incorporated into the basal ice layer, the frozen flute sediment would then be transported away from the boulder by ice flow, allowing the cavity to remain continuously open and the flute to propagate downflow.

The principal dimensions of total compensation that give rise to distinct reactions among employees were examined. Two samples of employees, 269 exempt employees and 297 nonexempt employees, were studied separately in order to identify the differences of reaction between these two groups. The relationships between the elements of total compensation, work motivation and job satisfaction were analysed by a structural equations model with LISREL VII. Proposals were developed to predict the conditions of compensation efficiency on work motivation and job satisfaction in the cultural context of employment in France. The three principal conclusions of the study were: (1) under certain conditions, individualized compensation of exempt employees can be a factor of work motivation; (2) flexible pay of nonexempt employees neither motivates nor increases job satisfaction; (3) benefits of exempt and nonexempt employees neither motivate nor increase job satisfaction.

This innovation conveys the novel insights that dynamic imagery can provide; yet, the imagery is developed from principles that make the representation useful when examined either statically or dynamically. This is because the development of the dynamic representation is guided by the same perceptual and technical principles used in making a motion picture. The particular implementation we describe is evaluated by a formal psychophysics experiment in which we measure the threshold correlation that can be perceived in our dynamic representation, and in each of three different types of graphical portrayals.

Measurements	Rob Hengeveld, Jaap Haeck	Journal of Biogeography	9	4	1982-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 303-316	Wiley	fla		We investigated the spatial distributions of densities within the geographical ranges of species of carabid beetles, birds and plants. Unselected data of hundreds of species from censures in sampling areas of varying size and location in northwestern Europe were analysed. The geographical distribution of species abundance is as a rule heterogeneous, with the highest abundances occurring near the centres of the species ranges and the lowest at the margins. As this trend was found in a great number of unselected species beloging to quite different biological taxa, we feel that this trend may be considered as a general biogeographical rule. We obtained this result mainly from indirect measurements, meaning that we deduce the geographical trend within species ranges from correlations of local frequencies of occurrence with the distance of the sampling area to the range centre for each species. The picture may be complicated by such biological properties as the species' feeding habits that also greatly affect their density, but within each of the groups distinguished we found that the same general rule applies. The interpretation of such peaked distributions in terms of two-dimensional ecological tolerance or optimum response surfaces in geographic space is discussed in a second paper.

MAHANEY	Human Biology	78	3	2006-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 341-352	Wayne State University Press	fla		Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), a high-density-lipoprotein-associated enzyme known to protect against cellular damage from toxic agents, may also have antioxidant properties. Although the importance of the influence of the PON1 structural locus on chromosome 7q21-22 for variation in the concentration and activity of the enzyme is well-documented, the contribution of other loci is poorly understood. Based on the recent observations of at least one additional quantitative trait locus (QTL) for PON1 activity in pedigreed baboons, we conducted a whole-genome linkage screen for QTLs other than the PON1 structural locus that may influence PON1 activity in humans. We measured PON1 activity in frozen serum for 1,406 individuals in more than 40 extended pedigrees from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). We used a maximum-likelihood-based variance decomposition approach implemented in SOLAR to test for QTLs that may influence PON1 activity. In addition to a QTL for which we detected the strongest, significant evidence (LOD = 31.41) at or near the PON1 structural locus on chromosome 7q21-22, we also localized at least one additional significant QTL on chromosome 12 (LOD = 3.56). Furthermore, we detected suggestive evidence for two more PCW-related QTLs on chromosomes 17 and 19. We have provided evidence that other genes, in addition to the well-known ones on chromosome 7, play a role in influencing normal variation in PON1 activity.

The evidence suggests that the detrimental effects of basing-point pricing for economic welfare were reflected entirely in the behavior of non-base-site firms.

To test whether some portion of frontier function departures can be systematically explained, the frontier inefficiency error component is modeled as a function of various causal factors and a random component. The functional form of the inefficiency error term model is chosen to assure strict one-sidedness. Preliminary empirical results generated from electric utility data suggest the superiority of including both systematic and random components in the inefficiency error term.

During the 14 days beginning with the first day of treatment, the attack rate for simian varicella was 14.3% (two of 14) among interferon recipients compared to 70% (nine of 13) among placebo recipients (P < 0.025). Excluding animals with antibody to simian varicella when the study began, 18% (two) of 11 interferon recipients had symptoms of infection compared to 80% (nine) of 11 placebo recipients (P < 0.025). The epizootic began in a room housing male animals. The incidence of infection in male placebo recipients was 100% (seven of seven) compared to 14% (one of seven) in male interferon recipients (P < 0.01). The efficacy of interferon prophylaxis in the simian varicella model supports its continued evaluation for the management of human varicella in high-risk patients.

Gates	Journal of Range Management	39	3	1986-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 200-207	Allen Press, Society for Range Management	fla		Selection of appropriate treatment and experiment designs are essential elements in research. However, the expense and variability associated with pasture renovation studies creates unique problems in the application of standard statistical techniques. Pasture-size renovation studies are restricted by expense, requiring the use of grazing exclosures (subsamples). Treatment design must include an adequate control for treatment comparison. Controls for pasture renovation practices cannot be limited to untreated areas within a grazing exclosure. The true measure response is found in the difference between treated areas and a typical grazed pasture situation. Criteria for exclosure selection (homogeneity) and heterogeneity of the grazed pasture may result in unequal variances or nonnormal error distributions, thus restricting the use of an analysis of variance. The experiment design must recognize the requirements for making reliable inferences. Pasture-to-pasture variability generally demands that pastures should be replicated in renovation studies to allow general inferences. Within pasture variability would support the need for multiple exclosures within each pasture. Costs associated with this kind of research limit the utility of idealized experimental designs. Several alternative experimental designs are discussed. Limitations in interpretation and risks of drawing erroneous or weak conclusions are reviewed.

Both the Spanish and American colonial experiences have had considerable influence on the processes of assimilation and of the development of the intra-structure of this dynamic community. The Philippine Chinese have developed an elaborate communal structure with a network of agencies which include familial, religious, commercial and educational institutions. The last three decades have witnessed profound changes in the institutional structure and demographic composition and distribution of the Philippine Chinese. Family and multiple clan groupings have reasserted themselves during a time of great social change and political uncertainty. Bien qu'ils soient en moins grand nombre que dans les groupes de la Thailande, del 'Indonésie et de la Malaisie, les Chinois Philippins ont une importance considérable au point de vue économique et historique. Les expériences coloniales espagnole et américaine ont eu une influence considérable sur les procédés d'assimilation et de développement de l'infrastructure de cette comunauté dynamique. Les Chinois Philippins out développé une structure communale composée d'un réseau d'agences comprenant les institutions religieuses, commerciales, familiales et les institutions d'enseignement. Les trois dernières décennies ont été témoins de changements profonds dans la structure institutiounelle, la composition démographique et la répartition des Chinois Philippins. Les groupements de famille et de clans multiples se sont réaffirmés pendant une période de grand changement social et d'incertitude au point de vue politique. Aunque menor en número que comunidades similares en Tailandia, Indonesia Y Malasia, los chinos filipinos son de considerable interés en términos económicos e históricos. La experiencia colonial española, así como la norteamericana, ha ejercido considerable influencia en el proceso de asimilización y el desarrollo de la intra-estructura de esta comunidad dinámica. Los chinos filipinos han desarrollado una estructura comunal complicada que comprende una red de agencias entre las cuales hay instituciones de familia, religiosas, comerciales Y educacionales. En las últimas tres décadas se han observado cambios profundos en la estructura institucional, en el compuesto demográfico Y en la distribución de los chinos filipinos. Agrupaciones de familia y de clanes múltiples se han reafirmado durante una época de grandes cambios sociales y de incertidumbre política.

These sites were distributed as follows: twelve in Siwa Oasis, fifteen in Bahariya Oasis, fifteen in Farafra Oasis, seven in Dakhla Oasis, fourteen in Kharga Oasis, fifteen in Faiyum Governorate and 27 in central Delta region. A total of 328 species belonging to 212 genera and 59 families were recorded. The highest numbers of species were found in the Faiyum Governorate and Bahariya Oasis while those of Kharga and Dakhla Oases were the lowest. The families with the highest number of species (60% of the total) were Poaceae (53 species), Asteraceae (37 species), Fabaceae (29 species), Cyperaceae (ninteen species), Chenopodiaceae (fifteen species), Brassicaceae (thirteen species), Caryophyllaceae (twelve species), Euphorbiaceae and Polygonaceae (ten species each). Six alien weedy species were recorded for the first time. In this study, five main habitat types were recognised which are supported by spatial analysis: i, farmlands (including irrigated crop-fields and orchards); ii, canal banks; iii, reclaimed lands; iv, waste lands (including moist and abandoned saline field plots but not salt marshes) and; v, water bodies. TWINSPAN and DCA analyses of 105 sites & 186 species of frequency percentages >5% showed six site groups, with the Nile land and the Oases croplands as clearly separated agro-ecosystems.

Wagner	Journal of Vegetation Science	19	5	2008-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 621-632	Wiley	fla		Question: What are the effects of different aspects of data collection and analysis on the spatial partitioning of ordination results by multiscale ordination? Locations: Heterogeneous pasture at Marchairuz in the Jura mountains, Switzerland and Mixed hardwood-pine forest in Oostings Natural Area, NC, USA. Methods: We evaluated the efficiency of different sampling designs for identifying the spatial structure of plant communities and analysed two datasets with multiscale ordination. We compared the effects of quadrat size, the number of species included in the analysis, data type, detrending and ordination method on the shape and precision of the community variogram summarizing spatial community structure. Results: A three-block sampling design provided a more even distribution of the number of pairs of observation per distance class than random, transect or grid designs. The precision of variogram estimates depended more strongly on the number of species than on the number of quadrats. In contrast, the choice of data type (abundance transformation) had little influence on the shape of the variogram. Detrending reduced the range of spatial autocorrelation. An increase in quadrat size resulted in a smoother variogram and stronger spatial autocorrelation. Principal components analysis (PCA) and Redundancy analysis (RDA) resulted in a larger range of spatial autocorrelation values than did Correspondence analysis (CA) and Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), but the shape of the variograms was similar. Conclusion: Random samples as well as transects and regular grids may not be efficient sampling designs for spatial analysis of community structure. While the number of species considered strongly affects the precision of a community variogram, its shape depends on the size of the sampling units. Earlier studies may have overestimated the spatial scale of internal organization in plant communities.

Using a Spanish survey study (INECSE, Evaluación de la Educación Primaria 2003, Madrid, 2005), this article intends to confirm and measure the poorer results of students in schools where immigrants are more highly represented. It also seeks to identify potential explanations to account for variation in attainment due to the concentration of immigrant origin students in some schools. In the literature, the empirical analyses that seek to explain this empirical regularity are far less frequent, despite the fact that the list of its potential causes includes several mediating mechanisms. We deal with three main groups of causes that could be responsible for this regularity: (i) micro-interactions or peer group effects; (ii) compositional effects—the pupil population is not randomly distributed on the school map but according to important features that determine their future school attainment (such as socio-economic status); and (iii) school/classroom effects—given their contextual characteristics, the quantity and quality of their human and material resources, some schools offer a less stimulating learning environment.

Faircloth, H. Lee Stribling, John P. Carroll	Ecological Applications	20	4	2010-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1040-1052	Ecological Society of America	fla		Habitat fragmentation, degradation, and loss have taxed early-successional species including the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and numerous grassland obligate birds. Translocation is often applied to counteract the consequences of habitat fragmentation through the creation, reestablishment, or augmentation of wild populations for the purposes of conservation, biodiversity maintenance. However, the implementation of these techniques is often conducted without valid experimental designs and therefore lacks robust, empirical data needed to evaluate and advance the knowledge and application of translocation. Despite the increasing amount of habitat management applied to patches among fragmented landscapes, a paucity of source populations often limits natural (re)colonization. As such, translocation may serve as a surrogate to natural dispersal, but its efficacy among fragmented landscapes is uncertain. Few studies exist that have assessed site fidelity, movement, and survival of individuals following translocation among fragmented landscapes. Thus, we experimentally evaluated the efficacy of translocation using known-fate and multi-strata models to evaluate hypotheses of temporal, biological, and group effects on survival and movement of translocated and resident bobwhites. We did not detect differences in survival or movement between translocated and resident bobwhites, suggesting that movement of individuals to a fragmented habitat does not negatively influence these demographic attributes. Based on these data, we suggest that two site-specific criteria should be met prior to instituting translocation: habitat management should be conducted to ensure that quality habitat exists and the patch size should be a minimum of 600 ha of quality habitat (poorer sites may warrant even larger patches). Translocation is a viable conservation method for increasing abundance in patches when habitat quality is high but source populations are limited.

Experiments were performed to determine the optimum size of sample, dimension of screen, number of samples, and the practicability of rapid analysis in the field to guide the progress of excavation. Analysis of variance was used to measure up to five variables at once; differences were shown graphically with direction of change indicated by a least-squares regression line. The analysis of 69 excavation units revealed an overwhelming preference for mud-dwelling species which showed no change in horizontal distribu-give guidance to the excavation team. Used with dry-weight analysis, field sorting would also indicate areas of richer occupation debris in time for this information to be useful. The use of applied mathematics in midden analysis adds a precise tool to the archaeological inventory. The data compiled on screen size, sample size, horizontal and vertical distributions, and such, were subjected to the analysis of variance, and where significant difference was indicated, the statistics were fitted to a regression line by the least-squares method. By using standardized systems and quantitative analysis, the archaeologist may obtain convincing evidence to support his conclusions. These procedures would be equally applicable to the study of skeletal, artifactual, or other ecological remains, and would add authority to the theories derived from such analysis.

These functions can be compromised by weak split selection algorithms that have variable selection biases or that fail to search beyond local main effects at each node of the tree. The resulting models may include many irrelevant variables or select too few of the important ones. Either eventuality can lead to erroneous conclusions. Four techniques to improve the precision of the models are proposed and their effectiveness compared with that of other algorithms, including tree ensembles, on real and simulated data sets.

Altman	Medical Care	31	7	1993-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 600-616	Lippincott Williams & Wilkins	fla		Although most American Indians and Alaska Natives have access to health care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), it is uncertain whether IHS is able to provide all necessary health services to those with disabilities. Although IHS eligibles can use health services other than those provided or sponsored by IHS, this may be precluded by high rates of poverty, low rates of other health insurance coverage, and the lack of private providers in many areas inhabited by this population. Using data from the 1987 Survey of American Indians and Alaska Natives-the only nationally representative health care survey of persons eligible for IHS-this study examines the use of ambulatory health care for IHS eligibles with disabilities. Comparisons with the total US population showed similar rates of ambulatory care use for most categories of disability, but a higher frequency of use for the total US population. Findings also show that IHS provides most of the health care for its eligible population, although non-IHS care is also used. After controlling for the effects of sociodemographic characteristics and health insurance coverage, variables indicating disabilities due to health problems were found to have statistically significant effects on the likelihood of using non-IHS care. Furthermore, persons with activity limitations had a higher than average likelihood of using most of their health care at non-IHS providers. These findings suggest that for some persons with disabilities, it is necessary to supplement IHS care with services from other providers.

Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were also determined in superficial sediments. Ammonium and phosphate dissolved in porewater were positively correlated with temperature (P &lt; 0.01) in muddy and sandy sediments, while the nitrogen-oxidized forms had a negative correlation (P &lt; 0.02) in muddy sediments probably because mineralization and nitrification/denitrification processes vary seasonally. Porewater ammonium profiles evidenced a peak in the top-most muddy sediment (380 μM) suggesting higher mineralization rate when oxygen is more available, while maximum phosphate concentration (113 μM) occurred in the sub-oxic layer probably due to phosphorus desorption under reduced conditions. In organically poor subtidal sandy sediments, nutrient porewater concentrations were always lower than in intertidal muddy sediments, ranging annually from 20 μM to 100 μM for ammonium and from 0.05 μM to 16 μM for phosphate. Nutrient diffusive fluxes predicted by a mathematical model were higher during summer, in both muddy (104 nmol cm⁻² d⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 8 nmol cm⁻² d⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>) and sandy sediments (26 nmol cm⁻² d⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 1 nmol cm⁻² d⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>), while during lower temperature periods these fluxes were 3-4 times lower. Based on simulated nutrient effluxes, the estimated annual amount of ammonium and phosphate exported from intertidal areas was three times higher than that released from subtidal areas (22 ton year⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 2 ton year⁻¹--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>), emphasizing the importance of tidal flats to maintain the high productivity of the lagoon. Global warming scenarios simulated with the model, revealed that an increase in lagoon water temperature only produces significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) for <tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math> in porewater and consequent diffusive fluxes, what will probably affect the system productivity due to a N/P ratio unbalance.

Straub	MIS Quarterly	25	1	2001-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-16	Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota	fla		Over 10 years ago, the issue of whether IS researchers were rigorously validating their quantitative, positivist instruments was raised (Straub 1989). In the years that have passed since that time, the profession has undergone many changes. Novel technologies and management trends have come and gone. New professional societies have been formed and grown in prominence and new demands have been placed on the field's research and teaching obligations. But the issue of rigor in IS research has persisted throughout all such changes. Without solid validation of the instruments that are used to gather data upon which findings and interpretations are based, the very scientific basis of positivist, quantitative research is threatened. As a retrospective on the Straub article, this research seeks to determine if and how the field has advanced in instrument validation. As evidence of the change, we coded positivist, quantitative research articles in five major journals over a recent three year period for use of validation techniques. Findings suggest that the field has advanced in many areas, but, overall, it appears that a majority of published studies are still not sufficiently validating their instruments. Based on these findings, approaches are suggested for reinvigorating the quest for validation in IS research via content/construct validity, reliability, and manipulation validity.

We show that firms exhibit conformity in their financing policies to those of geographically proximate firms and that the location of corporate headquarters helps explain the cross-sectional variation of capital structure in the United States. The location effect is robust to local credit market conditions and to state laws on corporate takeover and payout restrictions. The results suggest that noneconomic factors, such as local culture and social interactions among corporate executives, play a significant role in influencing corporate financial policies of firms headquartered in the same metropolitan area.

Pierce	Econometrica	54	4	1986-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 961-979	The Econometric Society	fla		Seasonally adjusted monetary aggregate data as published by the Federal Reserve,are subject to large revisions, which can be interpreted as error in the preliminary measures. Since short-run monetary policy is set for seasonally adjusted data when only preliminary estimates for recent months are available, an interesting question is: Would policy have been much different if final data had been available? For the period of the seventies, we estimate what would have been the monthly Federal Open Market Committee targets for M1 and the federal funds rate if the preliminary estimate of the rate of growth of seasonally adjusted M1 had been equal to the final one. We find that, despite their large size, revision errors seem to have little impact on the setting of targets. The results suggest that the Fed reacts to a signal in the rate of growth of M1 which is smoother than the seasonally adjusted series and less affected by revisions. Since the error associated with the revision is orthogonal to the preliminary measurement, while the noise extracted is orthogonal to the "true" variable (the signal), the analysis illustrates the different effects of the two alternative error-in-variable specifications.

The role of pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of 29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson's diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007 than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and pollinators.

Stomph	New Phytologist	186	3	2010-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 696-707	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		Lodging, the permanent displacement of crop plants from their vertical because of root or shoot failure, is a major yield constraint of the gluten free, panicle bearing cereal teff. The objective of this paper was to analyse the causes of lodging of teff by using, modifying and validating conventional biomechanical models. The model parameters were obtained from a field trial with two contrasting teff cultivars, using novel in situ and laboratory measurements under wet and dry conditions. Cross-species model validation was done with rice (Oryza sativa). Teff is more susceptible to root lodging than to shoot lodging, although the data indicated that shoot strength is also insufficient. Hence, simultaneously breeding for both improved root anchorage and shoot strength is advocated. The study showed that the lodging model, derived for the spike-bearing cereal wheat, needed modifications in order to be able to deal with panicle-bearing plants such as teff and rice. Water adhering to plants owing to rain or dew increased calculated lodging susceptibility. To prevent underestimation of lodging susceptibility, future lodging research should be done under completely wet conditions (water saturated soil and wetted shoots)

Daniel, Michael Fox, Sagar Mehta	Biological Bulletin	215	1	2008-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 24-33	Marine Biological Laboratory	fla		Crustaceans sample odorants by a rapid series of flicks of the two flagella composing the distal segments of each of the paired antennules. The lateral flagella contain aesthetasc sensilla that house unimodal chemosensory neurons. Nine types of nonaesthetasc setae with putative chemosensory and mechanosensory functions are distributed on the lateral and medial flagella. Sensory neurons in aesthetascs and nonaesthetasc sensilla terminate in separate regions of the brain, the olfactory lobe, and the laternal antennular neuropil, resulting in two odorant-processing pathways. Distilled water ablation of flagella and excision of specific setae were used to identify chemosensory sensilla mediating antennular flick behavior in Panulirus argus. The flick rates of sham-ablated and ablated or excised lobsters toward squid extract were compared. Complete attenuation of flick response to squid extract occurred as a result of (1) distilled water ablation of lateral flagella, (2) excision of aesthetascs and asymmetric sensilla, and (3) excision of aesthetascs. Distilled water ablation of medial flagella resulted in a mean flick rate 52% of that observed for sham-ablated lobsters toward squid extract. Flicking was unaffected by excision of asymmetric, guard, or companion sensilla. We propose that odorant mediation of flicking behavior requires both the aesthetasc and nonaesthetasc pathways.

Eggs of windowpane flounder (Scophthalmus aquosus) ranked second in abundance and were present in both spring and fall. Other dominant larvae were winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) and American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus). Their combined density reached 8  m<sup>-3</sup> and accounted for the winter peak in larvae. The seasonality of abundance of larval fish was strongly correlated with reported densities of copepod nauplii prey.

It is natural because it is rooted in the realm of human nature. The State is essential for good life- in other words it is the State, which creates the condition to live a happy life. Man needs the State to satisfy his diverse needs. In fact, in the absence of such a controlling and regulating authority, society cannot be held together and there will be disorder and chaos. The recent origin of terrorism in many countries such as India, Afghanistan, Serbia, Estonia and Israel etc. has necessitated the need of State to protect the life of innocent people. The horror of Sept. 11th in America has proved that the State is required to control such activities of unsocial elements. Thus State is needed to protect society.

Series A (Statistics in Society)	167	2	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 209-248	Royal Statistical Society, Wiley	fla		The 2001 census in the UK asked for a return of people 'usually living at this address'. But this phrase is fuzzy and may have led to undercount. In addition, analysis of the sex ratios in the 2001 census of England and Wales points to a sex bias in the adjustments for net undercount-too few males in relation to females. The Office for National Statistics's abandonment of the method of demographic analysis for the population of working ages has allowed these biases to creep in. The paper presents a demographic account to check on the plausibility of census results. The need to revise preliminary estimates of the national population over a period of years following census day-as experienced in North America and now in the UK-calls into question the feasibility of a one-number census. Looking to the future, the environment for taking a reliable census by conventional methods is deteriorating. The UK Government's proposals for a population register open up the possibility of a Nordic-style administrative record census in the longer term.

Navarrete, Tatiana Manzur	Ecology	89	7	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 2005-2018	Ecological Society of America	fla		Investigating how food supply regulates the behavior and population structure of predators remains a central focus of population and community ecology. These responses will determine the strength of bottom-up processes through the food web, which can potentially lead to coupled top-down regulation of local communities. However, characterizing the bottom-up effects of prey is difficult in the case of generalist predators and particularly with predators that have large dispersal scales, attributes that characterize most marine top predators. Here we use long-term data on mussel, barnacle, limpet, and other adult prey abundance and recruitment at sites spread over 970 km to investigate individual- and population-level responses of the keystone intertidal sunstar Heliaster helianthus on the coast of Chile. Our results show that this generalist predator responds to changes in the supply of an apparently preferred prey, the competitively dominant mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. Individual-level parameters (diet composition, per capita prey consumption, predator size) positively responded to increased mussel abundance and recruitment, whereas population-level parameters (density, biomass, size structure) did not respond to bottom-up prey variation among sites separated by a few kilometers. No other intertidal prey elicited positive individual predator responses in this species, even though a large number of other prey species was always included in the diet. Moreover, examining predator—prey correlations at ~80, 160, and 200 km did not change this pattern, suggesting that positive prey feedback could occur over even larger spatial scales or as a geographically unstructured process. Thus individual-level responses were not transferred to population changes over the range of spatial scales examined here, highlighting the need to examine community regulation processes over multiple spatial scales.

While PAM was not in fact designed to be terrorism futures, I here consider five design issues with implementing and using real terrorism futures: combinatorics, manipulation, moral hazard, hiding prices, and decision selection bias. As neither these nor other problems seem insurmountable, terrorism futures appears to be a technically realistic possibility.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the protection are incompletely understood. Ischemia induces significant alterations in cellular redox status that plays a critical role in cell survival/death pathways. We investigated the effects of Hsp70 overexpression on cellular redox status in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells under both hypoxic and ischemic conditions with 3 different approaches: reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement by a fluorescence probe, redox environment evaluation by a hydroxylamine spin probe, and redox status assessment by the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio. Results from each of these approaches showed that the redox status in Hsp70 cells was more reducing than that in control cells under either hypoxic or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. In order to determine the mechanisms that mediated the alterations in redox state in Hsp70 cells, we measured the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), two GSH-related antioxidant enzymes. We found that OGD exposure increased GPx and GR activities 47% and 55% from their basal levels (no stress) in Hsp70 cells, compared to only 18% and 0% increase in control cells, respectively. These data, for the first time, indicate that Hsp70 modulates the activities of GPx and GR that regulate cellular redox status in response to ischemic stress, which may be important in Hsp70's cytoprotective effects.

Since individuals on average use additional income to make their lives safer and healthier, the regulatory costs lead to higher mortality risks and fatalities. Based on data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study relating income to the risk of dying, approximately each $5 million of regulatory cost induces a fatality if costs are borne equally among the public. If costs are borne proportional to income, approximately $11.5 million in regulatory costs induces a fatality. Cost-induced fatalities disproportionally burden the poor and minorities, particularly blacks.

Three sets of factors are evaluated to determine whether they account for differences between immigrants of different origins and natives: individual human capital, social capital of nativity groups, and economic conditions in state of residence. The analysis shows that while human capital factors are the most important sources of differences between immigrants and natives in internal migration patterns, contextual dimensions associated with the social capital of nativity groups and state economic conditions also strongly influence interstate migration of immigrants.

Landis	Journal of the American Statistical Association	54	286	1959-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 335-357	American Statistical Association	fla		The following bibliographic essay is a critical review of many sources on statistics of religious affiliation, including references to studies by social scientists that treat of or are closely related to religious affiliation. It is found that statistics of religious affiliation generally originate with the unstandardized records kept by clergymen or lay clerks in over 300,000 local churches, who are for the most part untrained. Officials of national religious bodies probably receive and publish reports from most local churches, but a considerable proportion of these officers make public official reports that are only their own estimates. Periodic compilations of "the latest information" are noted. A brief summary of the U.S. Censuses of Religious Bodies is also made. A Church Distribution Study is described. Social scientists probably regard most current statistics on religious affiliation as crude. The limitations and defects of these statistics have received relatively little documentary study by trained statisticians.

We also examined, in the laboratory, the F1 generation from each pond by incubating them with or without cues from predatory fish. The potential benefits of a behavioral avoidance response were also assessed in an experiment in which G. pulex from the different ponds and incubations were exposed to fish predation. G. pulex from fish ponds increased their refuge use when exposed to fish cues, whereas populations from fishless ponds reduced their refuge use. The F1 generation responded similarly to their parents. Only the F1 generation from fish pond populations responded with more pronounced antipredatory behavior when raised in fish water. Moreover, both the original and the F1 generation of fish pond G. pulex survived longer when exposed to fish predation than those from fishless ponds, independent of whether they were raised in fish water or not (F1). Our results suggest that the behavioral response to predator cues in G. pulex is an inherited trait, i.e., a local adaptation to prevailing predator regimes.

Witter	Proceedings: Biological Sciences	260	1358	1995-05-22T00:00:00Z	pp. 219-223	The Royal Society	fla		It has been proposed that levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) may be used in establishing and maintaining dominance hierarchies, as asymmetry reflects aspects of individual quality. However, previous manipulations of FA have failed to reveal that the level or outcome of agonistic intra-sexual interactions are affected by levels of FA. In female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), correlational data suggest that FA of the speckled chest plumage may be related to dominance status. These data are confounded, however, by total number of spots on the chest and the proportion of the chest that is white, both of which positively covary with chest asymmetry. Thus, we deconfounded the effects of these plumage traits on dominance by experimentally manipulating the number of spots and spot number asymmetry in a factorial design. The results indicated that dominance is influenced by the number of spots on the chest, but not by spot asymmetry. Birds with spottier chests were dominant over birds with experimentally decreased spot number. We suggest that female starlings' chests are exposed to extensive abrasion throughout the breeding season and so are susceptible to damage asymmetries that may mask the `true' fluctuating asymmetry of the trait. This may devalue the use of chest asymmetry as a quality indicator. Spottier chests may be costly to maintain, in part because of increased susceptibility to abrasion, and so may be a better indicator of quality than asymmetry.

These regression equations were subsequently used to estimate blackbrush utilization by domestic goats in a browsing study. The diameter-length equation compared favorably with before-and-after measurements for accuracy and greatly reduced man-hour costs in determining utilization. Estimates of utilization based on the diameter-weight equation were less than estimates based on the before-and-after approach or the diameter-length equation; the diameter-weight equation accounted for leaves and thus provided a more accurate estimate of utilization.

A retrospective chart review identified all patients who underwent ICD implantation at a university medical center from November 1982 through February 1990. Several patient and procedural variables were compared between infected patients and noninfected patients. One hundred fifty-seven patients underwent 202 ICD generator implantations (45 generator changes), and nine of these patients developed infection (4.5% per implantation and 5.7% per patient). Of the patient variables analyzed, a significant correlation (P < .0001) was made only with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: 36% of diabetics versus 3.9% of nondiabetics were infected. The only patient-or procedure-specific variable that was found to correlate with the development of infection was the presence of diabetes mellitus.

We treat models in which Y is censored from above, below, or both. The basic idea is to first estimate the derivative of the conditional mean of Y given X at x with respect to x on the uncensored sample without correcting for the effect of x on the censored population. We then correct the derivative for the effects of the selection bias. We discuss nonparametric and semiparametric estimators for the derivative. We also discuss the cases of discrete regressors and of endogenous regressors in both cross section and panel data contexts.

The study focused on the Buenos Aires province coast because its variant geomorphology represents the different morphologies along the whole of the Argentinean coastline. The aim of this article is to study the response of two of the coastal vulnerability equations to the environmental diversity and to determine which one is more suitable to be applied to the rest of the country. On verifying the equations, CVI6 was found to be more appropriate for the analysis of coasts with different morphologies. Depending on the physical characteristics of each area, the consequences would include flooding and the loss of low lands in areas such as the Samborombón Bay, Bahía Blanca Estuary, and Anegada Bay, and the eroding of the beaches between Punta Rasa and Bahía Blanca.

Gordus	The Journal of Wildlife Management	63	2	1999-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 497-501	Wildlife Society, Wiley	fla		Avian reproductive impairment has been observed at tile-drainage agricultural evaporation basins in the San Joaquin Valley, California, where evaporation basin operators are required to mitigate for reproductive effects to wildlife that feed and nest at these sites. We compared recurvirostrid eggs collected at a 296-ha selenium-contaminated agricultural evaporation basin from 1987 to 1996 and at a 58-ha freshwater mitigation wetland from 1994 to 1996. The eggs were analyzed to determine if selenium exposure changed at the evaporation basin after the freshwater mitigation wetland was established. Mean concentrations of selenium in American avocet (Recurvirostra americana) eggs were significantly lower (P < 0.05) at the evaporation basin during the postmitigation period (4.8 mg/kg) compared to the premitigation period (7.1 mg/kg), indicating that the presence of a freshwater wetland resulted in reduced selenium exposure. The significant decrease in selenium concentrations in avocets across years suggests the mitigation wetland provided a site for these birds to dilute their dietary selenium intake. Additionally, selenium concentrations in avocet eggs were similar (P > 0.05) between the 2 sites during the postmitigation period. In contrast, selenium concentrations in black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) eggs at the evaporation basin did not differ (P > 0.05) between the pre- and postmitigation periods (4.5 mg/kg vs. 5.4 mg/kg). Selenium concentrations in stilt eggs were lower (P < 0.05) at the mitigation wetland (3.5 mg/kg) compared to the evaporation basin (5.4 mg/kg) during the postmitigation period. These results indicate that while creation of the freshwater mitigation wetland provided new breeding and a "clean" foraging habitat for stilts, these mitigation efforts did not succeed in reducing selenium intake by stilts that continued to nest at the evaporation basin. However, the freshwater wetland provided a "clean" foraging area for stilts, which tend to select for freshwater habitats, and successfully attracted stilts away from the evaporation basin.

Agricultural scientists needed to take account of actual farmer activities, since farm breeding work predated the efforts scientists were undertaking to understand heredity. Pearl considered the work of practical farmers and breeders in his own scientific research and thought about how his work, in return, would contribute to practice.

On montre tout d'abord que cette hypothèse appelle une interprétation tantôt comme condition d'équilibre, tantôt comme exigence de rationalité individuelle. On s'interroge ensuite sur la compatibilité de ces deux interprétations, avant de conclure par la négative. II n'est méme pas établi qu'une fois à l'équilibre d'anticipations rationnelles, des agents rationnels ne devraient pas en dévier. L'hypothèse apparaît comme un concept formel de stationnarité en univers stochastique plutôt qu'elle ne décrit la rationalité cognitive des agents. L'argumentation repose sur une analyse des difficultés et paradoxes qui surgissent dans les modèles de révision des croyances (ou d'“apprentissage des anticipations rationnelles”). This article is intended to clarify a semantic puzzle raised by the definition of rational expectations (R.E.) in Muth's and Lucas's seminal papers. Both authors equivocate between an equilibrium condition interpretation and an individual rationality requirement. The two views of R.E. could be reconciled by demonstrating that the R.E. equilibrium is underpinned by some convergent rational learning process. However, each and every single dynamic R.E. model has failed for some reason, and it is not even sure that, once at the R.E. equilibrium, rational agents should not deviate from it. Hence, there is an unfilled gap yawning between the two views of the rational expectations hypothesis, which is best construed as a formal stationarity condition devised for stochastic contexts.

Angevine	The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique	7	2	1974-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 273-289	Canadian Economics Association, Wiley	fla		Forecasting consumption with a Canadian consumer sentiment measure. This study examines the forecasting potential of a composite index of consumer mood derived from responses to four questions in the Financial Post's `Quarterly Survey of Consumer Buying Intentions.' Efforts to explain the sentiment measure stochastically and to incorporate an endogenous sentiment variable within a small consumption sector model are discussed. Variables reflecting households' price and employment expectations are shown to be important determinants of consumer mood and the sentiment functions are found to be relatively stable. Both exogenous and endogenous sentiment variables are shown to enhance the accuracy of sample-period simulations and consumption `forecasts' simulated beyond the sample-period. /// La prévision de la consommation avec un indicateur de l'état d'esprit des consommateurs canadiens. Dans cet article, l'auteur étudie l'utilité d'un indicateur de l'état d'esprit des consommateurs pour la prévision des données trimestrielles des comptes nationaux sur les dépenses de consommation. Cet indicateur est basé sur le relevé trimestriel du Financial Post sur les intentions d'achat des consommateurs. Il est obtenu en faisant la moyenne pondérée des réponses à quatre questions de nature plutôt générale du relevé et qui portent sur les attitudes des consommateurs; les réponses affirmatives de même que les indications « incertain » sont retenues. L'auteur tente au départ d'expliquer l'état d'esprit du consommateur de façon stochastique dans le but de faciliter sa spécification comme variable endogène dans un modèle de prévision. Par régression avec les moindres carrés, il trouve que les variables qui représentent les attentes des ménages quant aux prix et à l'emploi sont des déterminants importants du niveau de l'indice de l'état d'esprit. Il montre que les tests de Chow semblent indiquer que les fonctions de l'état d'esprit sont relativement stables durant la période sur laquelle porte l'échantillon (1961-9), même si l'importance relative des anticipations sur les prix et l'emploi a évidemment varié durant cette période. Dans la partie suivante de l'article, l'auteur utilise un modèle qui comprend un petit secteur de consommation pour évaluer, par simulation, l'utilité de l'indicateur de l'état d'esprit. Ce modèle explique le volume des déboursés réels par ménage pour l'automobile, les autres biens durables, les biens semi-durables, les biens non durables et les services. Trois versions différentes du modèle sont retenues pour cet exercice: (1) sans spécification de l'état d'esprit du consommateur; (2) avec spécification de l'état d'esprit comme variable exogène dans chacune des fonctions de consommation; (3) avec spécification de l'état d'esprit comme variable rendue endogène avec une équation déjà estimée dans l'article. L'auteur montre que les deux versions de l'indice d'état d'esprit, exogène et endogène, améliorent la précision des simulations portant sur la période de l'échantillon, et aussi des simulations de « prévisions » de la consommation au-delà de cette période. Les résultats obtenus indiquent que les données sur l'état d'esprit des consommateurs canadiens peuvent être utiles dans un modèle de prévisions macroéconomiques.

McCutcheon	The Public Opinion Quarterly	49	4	1985-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 474-488	American Association for Public Opinion Research, Oxford University Press	fla		Latent class analysis is used to examine the proposition that political ideology plays a role in the public's tolerance for nonconformity. Results from an analysis of a representative sample of adult Americans indicate that political tolerance is neither a simple dichotomy (i.e., tolerant vs. intolerant) nor a undimensional continuum. Support is found for a four-class model of political tolerance, in which one segment of the American mass public is classified as generally tolerant, another as generally intolerant, a third as intolerant of the left, and the fourth as intolerant of the right. A log-linear analysis is used to examine the effects of education and age cohort on political tolerance.

Rosenthal	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	204	7	2011-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1120-1124	Oxford University Press	fla		We compared the prevalence of key pfmdr1 alleles between pretreatment Plasmodium falciparum parasite isolates and parasites that emerged after treatment of uncomplicated malaria in a longitudinal cohort of Ugandan children. The pfmdr1 86N, 184F, and 1246D alleles were selected after treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, but not after artesunate-amodiaquine or amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Remarkably, selection persisted in infections presenting up to about 60 days after treatment with artemether-lumefantrine. Thus, parasites selected for decreased drug sensitivity can appear long after predicted exposure to antimalarial drugs. Continued surveillance of the clinical efficacy and in vitro activity of new combination therapies is warranted.

Chauhan	Ursus	15	2	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 203-211	International Association for Bear Research and Management	fla		In the North Bilaspur Forest Division in Madhya Pradesh, India, the sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) population is ecologically isolated, and some bears have developed aggressive behavior. Available bear habitat is highly fragmented and degraded and is interspersed with human habitation. In this study we assessed habitat use patterns of sloth bears with the goal of establishing management guidelines to reduce human-bear conflicts. Goodness-of-fit comparisons showed that expected use of each habitat category differed from habitat availability. Bear sign was most frequent in sal forest followed by land near water, sal mixed forest, and mixed forest. However, bear use of terrain categories was not different from expected use. A large number of bear dens were near water and human settlements. Bears regularly used more than 50% of observed den sites. Because of nearness to human settlement and degraded habitat, bears largely depended on villages for food, resulting in frequent human-bear encounters, some of which led to maulings and fatalities. One management priority is to protect highly preferred habitats of sloth bears. Bear population control and translocation of bears from isolated habitat patches to more suitable areas may be carried out simultaneously with education and awareness programs to conserve this species and to mitigate human-bear conflicts on a long-term basis.

Singer	The Journal of Cell Biology	119	5	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1245-1260	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		The distribution of poly(A) RNA has been visualized in single cells using high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization. Digital imaging microscopy was used to quantitate the signal in various cellular compartments. Most of the poly(A) signal remained associated with the cellular filament systems after solubilization of membranes with Triton, dissociation of ribosomes with puromycin, and digestion of nonpoly(A) RNA with ribonuclease A and  T<sub>1</sub>. The actin filaments were shown to be the predominant cellular structural elements associating with the poly(A) because low doses of cytochalasin released about two-thirds of the poly(A). An approach to assess the extent of colocalization of two images was devised using in situ hybridization to poly(A) in combination with probes for ribosomes, membranes, or F-actin. Digital imaging microscopy showed that most poly(A) spatially distributes most significantly with ribosomes, slightly less with F-actin, and least of all with membranes. The results suggest a mechanism for anchoring (and perhaps moving) much of the cellular mRNA utilizing the interaction between actin filaments and poly(A).

Roberts	Oikos	121	1	2012-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 127-137	Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley	fla		Spatial variation in extinction and colonization is expected to influence community composition over time. In stream fish communities, local species richness (alpha diversity) and species turnover (beta diversity) are thought to be regulated by high extinction rates in headwater streams and high colonization rates in downstream areas. We evaluated the spatiotemporal structure offish communities in streams originally surveyed by Burton and Odum 1945 (Ecology 26: 182-194) in Virginia, USA and explored the effects of species traits on extinction and colonization dynamics. We documented dramatic changes in fish community structure at both the site and stream scales. Of the 34 fish species observed, 20 (59%) were present in both time periods, but 11 (32%) colonized the study area and three (9%) were extirpated over time. Within streams, alpha diversity increased in two of three streams but beta diversity decreased dramatically in all streams due to fish community homogenization caused by colonization of common species and extirpation of rare species. Among streams, however, fish communities differentiated over time. Regression trees indicated that reproductive life-history traits such as spawning mound construction, associations with mound-building species, and high fecundity were important predictors of species persistence or colonization. Conversely, native fishes not associated with mound-building exhibited the highest rates of extirpation from streams. Our results demonstrate that stream fish colonization and extinction dynamics exhibit hierarchical spatial structure and suggest that mound-building fishes serve as keystone species for colonization of headwater streams.

The reading performances of 111 six- to seven-year-old children were tested four times during their first year of primary school. In the same time, the children's use of a task-avoidant versus a task-focused achievement strategy in the classroom context was rated by their teachers. Parents filled in questionnaires measuring their general beliefs about their children's school performance and their reading-specific beliefs at the beginning and at the end of the school year. The results showed that parents' beliefs in their children's general school competence predicted their children's use of a task-focused strategy and a lack of task-avoidance, which further predicted the children's high level of reading performance. Moreover, children's use of a task-focused achievement strategy increased parents' high beliefs in their children's general competence, whereas the children's reading performance was reflected in their parents' skill-specific beliefs. /// [Spanish] Este estudio investiga la dinámica evolutiva entre las estrategias de adquisición de los niños, el desempeño en lectura y las creencias de los padres, usando datos longitudinales.

To understand this phenomenon better, we studied zebra finches hearing playbacks of birdsong. Earlier research had shown that initial playbacks of a novel song transiently increase the ZENK (ZIF-268, EGR1. NGFIA, KROX-24) mRNA in the auditory forebrain, but the response selectively habituates after repetition of the stimulus. Here, using DNA microarray analysis, we show that novel song exposure induces rapid changes in thousands of RNAs, with even more RNAs decreasing than increasing. Habituation training leads to the emergence of a different gene expression profile a day later, accompanied by loss of essentially all of the rapid "novel" molecular responses. The novel molecular profile is characterized by increases in genes involved in transcription and RNA processing and decreases in ion channels and putative noncoding RNAs. The "habituated" profile is dominated by changes in genes for mitochondrial proteins. A parallel proteomic analysis [2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and sequencing by mass spectrometry] also detected changes in mitochondrial proteins, and direct enzyme assay demonstrated changes in both complexes I and IV in the habituated state. Thus a natural experience, in this case hearing the sound of birdsong, can lead to major shifts in energetics and macromolecular metabolism in higher centers in the brain.

When a biologically potent pool is found, the goal is to decode the pool, i.e., to determine which of the individual compounds are potent. We propose augmenting the data on pooled testing with information on the chemical structure of compounds in order to complete the decoding process. This proposal is based on the well-known relationship between biological potency of a compound and its chemical structure. Application to real data from a drug discovery process at GlaxoSmithKline reveals a 100% increase in hit rate, namely, the number of potent compounds identified divided by the number of tests required.

Series B (Statistical Methodology)	66	1	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 239-257	Royal Statistical Society, Wiley	fla		Recurrent events models have had considerable attention recently. The majority of approaches show the consistency of parameter estimates under the assumption that censoring is independent of the recurrent events process of interest conditional on the covariates that are included in the model. We provide an overview of available recurrent events analysis methods and present an inverse probability of censoring weighted estimator for the regression parameters in the Andersen-Gill model that is commonly used for recurrent event analysis. This estimator remains consistent under informative censoring if the censoring mechanism is estimated consistently, and it generally improves on the naïve estimator for the Andersen-Gill model in the case of independent censoring. We illustrate the bias of ad hoc estimators in the presence of informative censoring with a simulation study and provide a data analysis of recurrent lung exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients when some patients are lost to follow-up.

The objective depends on the management philosophy for completing the remaining work that cannot be done within the predefined boundaries of stations. We adopt the US philosophy and consider minimising the total amount of work to be completed by utility workers. Since the optimum solution procedures are found to be computationally intractable, most of the attention has been devoted to developing efficient heuristics. We propose stochastic algorithms which are combinations of Simulated Annealing and problem specific knowledge methods. Posterior and prior formulas are developed to determine lower bounds on the optimal objective values. Extended computational experiments indicate that very good results and often optimal ones can be obtained for most practical problems.

Aspects of health and health care worthy of attention during the 1990s include such classic geographical themes as human use of the environment, diffusion, migration, urbanization and urban structure, cultural pluralism and regional inequalities. Geographical research on disease ecology in the 1980s examined the role of environmental characteristics in the distribution of particular diseases and the contribution of ecological and socioeconomic variables to differential risk of infection. The diseases and countries where they were studied included valley fever and Chagas disease in Mexico, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis in Puerto Rico, childhood diarrhea in Grenada and Bolivia and schistosomiasis, malaria, variola minor and respiratory illness in children in Brazil. Most of these studies of specific diseases effectively employed local-level mapping. Some geographers used official statistics and records to examine spatial patterns of health and illness within a country (Chile, Costa Rica and Jamaica) or smaller political unit (in Brazil and Colombia). Research on the provision and utilization of health services was conducted in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Grenada, Guatemala and Jamaica.

Mothers' emotion and personality characteristics were assessed with expressive-behavior ratings and self-report scales. Infant characteristics were measured by emotion and temperament questionnaires (mother report) and objective coding of facial expressions of emotions. Attachment classifications were determined by means of the Strange Situation procedure, and a continuous-variable index of attachment security was derived by a discriminant function procedure. Mothers' emotion experiences, expressive behaviors, and personality traits were significant predictors of the level of security of the infant-mother attachment. Infants' expressive and temperamental characteristics as rated by their mothers were also significant predictors of attachment security.

A retrospective analysis of the program was conducted to examine general trends in island use and nest success from 1984-2005. A series of candidate models was generated to determine how habitat, island and biological variables were associated with island use and nest success from 1996-2005. Use of islands by Dusky Geese increased between 1987 and 2005 from 10% to 44%; apparent nest success averaged 64 ± 4% and showed no trend with year. Island use was consistently and strongly associated with the previous year's island status. The odds of nesting on an island that contained a successful nest the previous year were four times greater than for islands not used the previous year. Likelihood of island use was highest at moderate shrub cover and increased with shrub height. Likelihood of nest success increased on islands further from shore. The influence of year suggests the presence of alternate prey and predator abundance is more important to nest success than island features. The increasing use of islands while the CRD Dusky Goose population has been declining indicates that islands may be increasingly important to population productivity. However, quantifying the contribution of the island program requires a better understanding of other population metrics, such as gosling mortality.

Feinstone	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	104	20	2007-05-15T00:00:00Z	pp. 8449-8454	National Academy of Sciences	fla		Neutralizing antibodies directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are present in Igs made from anti-HCV-positive plasma. However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412-419 (epitope I) and 434-446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.

The study's framework was built on theories derived from qualitative data. The investigator observed 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds in a researcher-designed music center where videotapes of sessions were used to analyze data through the constant comparative method. Three theoretical core categories emerged from data analysis: conditions, interactions, and outcomes. The properties of the first core category, which involves preexisting behavioral qualities that influence movement responses, are dispositions, developmental stage, and mode of representation. The properties of the second core category are modeling, describing, and suggesting, which are the overt behaviors of children and teacher that influence movement responses. The properties related to the third core category are music-related movement responses and nonmusic-related movement responses. The primary result of the study was the generation of a substantive theory of children's movement responses to music. The author also derived implications of the seven propositions for early childhood education and movement responses to music.

We find that accounting for firms' factor-market decisions significantly increases measured cost pass-through, although we reject the hypothesis of full cost pass-through and constant markups. In addition, our evidence suggests that cost shocks common to all manufacturers have a greater effect on prices than do model-specific cost shocks. Finally, we examine how pass-through varies with manufacturer nationality, finding that U.S. firm cost pass-through exceeds that of European and Asian firms.

Yalden	Journal of Biogeography	21	2	1994-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 169-182	Wiley	fla		The historic ranges of three equid species native to north-east Africa are analysed with respect to annual rainfall, several temperature parameters and a satellite-derived multispectral index of primary productivity. Equus africanus Fitzinger, Equus grevyi Oustalet and Equus burchelli Gray used to largely replace each other, geographically, with narrow zones of range overlap occurring between E. africanus and E. grevyi in the Awash valley, and between E. grevyi and E. burchelli in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. The three species are shown to succeed each other along an environmental gradient. The position of each species on this gradient and the resulting location and extent of its range are discussed. Competitive exclusion, specific adaptations and historic events are likely determinants of equid distribution. In the area of sympatry between E. grevyi and E. burchelli, mixed habitat characters as well as environmental fluctuations seem to prevent either species from excluding the other. Different social organizations of E. grevyi and E. burchelli and the resulting migratory patterns may be adaptations to the environment in their allopatric ranges; in their sympatric range they could alleviate competition.

Sharpe, Inc.	fla		There are many benefits of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, but their implementation is both complicated and difficult because the product spans functional silos and involves many internal and external entities. An ERP system is the outcome of social processes, and different ERP systems can embody distinct social arrangements when developed in different cultural contexts. Such social arrangements are difficult to change due the closure effect of technology stabilization. This leads to various misfit problems, both during and after ERP implementation, causing adverse effects on delivered ERP quality. With a survey of 85 ERP implementation cases in Taiwan, this study derives and empirically tests the main as well as the interaction effects of the country of origin of the ERP package, consultant quality, top management support, and user support of the ERP system quality as perceived by the client after implementation. The results demonstrate the important role of the country of origin of the ERP package and consultant quality in configuring a high-quality ERP system and alleviating the negative effect of misfit problems.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is hyperendemic in drug injectors, yet social structural and behavioral factors underlying transmission are not well established. Methods. We conducted a case-control study ofHCV seroconversion in drug injectors, focusing on transmission within networks. Incident case subjects (n = 17) and seronegative control subjects (n = 42) reported injection and sex partners and referred as many as 5 for interviewing and blood testing. We performed nucleotide sequencing of HCV isolates from infected individuals. Results. Seventy-eight percent of recent injection partnerships involved behavior that could transmit HCV. Case subjects and control subjects were similar demographically and behaviorally. Case subjects, however, had more HCV-infected partners and consequently engaged in injection risk behavior with more infected partners. The injection network was mostly connected, dense, and cyclic, but the sexual network was highly fragmented. Although participants generally injected with partners of similar age, most HCV-uninfected participants recently had injected with infected partners. In at least 1 of 4 pairs of genetically linked infections, transmission appeared to be due to sharing of injection equipment other than syringes. Except for transmission pairs, network distance between incident case subjects and genetic distance between their HCV variants were uncorrelated. Conclusions. Without dramatic reductions in injection risk behaviors, shattering of cohesive injection networks, and/or broad coverage of an effective vaccine, HCV will likely remain hyperendemic in drug injectors.

Osagie	Social Indicators Research	107	3	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 531-560	Springer	fla		Emotion's twin roles–'unite and divide' our daily life, thus motivating the good and the worst in human behaviour. The way one "feels" does influence the way one "acts" toward others. If this reasoning is correct, then behaviour can never be without motive or "motiveless." Given the importance of emotions in human communication and decision making, the context of intergroup relations, with its themes of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination against culturally dissimilar was touched on selectively. Using the Differential Emotions Scale and building upon Boyle's (Personality 56:747–750, 1984) work, with students, the present study reports a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for items across raters. The findings further indicate that most of the DES items are sensitive indicators. The correspondence of some of the results with prior research findings makes facial emotions less the holy grail of the social behaviour field. Likely consequences of emotions are considered, and research needs are discussed vis-a-vis uplifting individual happiness, collective identity and sense of connection to others. Perhaps its implications can be extended to the literature, thus revealing how the different lenses through which human emotions are usually viewed are connected by the incipient/concept attitude and self-identification/labelling that run through each of them.

In den letzten 25 Jahren ist die Abhängigkeit der fortgeschrittenen Länder vom Welthandel jedoch stark gestiegen, und zwar hauptsächlich wegen der verstärkten intraindustriellen Spezialisierung, die durch statische und dynamische Skalenerträge vorangetrieben wurde, insbesondere solche, die sich aus F & E-sowie Design-Aktivitäten ergeben. Solche Skalenerträge werden erzielt, wenn breitgefächerte Industrien in sehr spezialisierte Segmente aufgespalten werden. Angesichts dieser internationalen Entwicklungen bei der Industrialisierung sollte das Ziel, Kapitalgüter aus eigener Kraft produzieren zu wollen, revidiert werden, es sei denn, die Entwicklungsländer sind bereit, (i) diese Industrie oder große Teile davon ständig zu subventionieren und (ii) hinsichtlich der meisten Technologien, die in dem Kapitalgütersektor benutzt werden, auf Dauer von den Industrieländern abhängig zu sein.

Most of the proposed hypotheses have been tested using indirect methods. Protection against predators, advertisement for vertebrates to avoid web damage, and increasing prey attraction are the most popular hypotheses. In this study, I tested the prey attraction hypothesis on the silk decorations of the araneid Argiope savignyi using a trial tunnel built in the field, in which I exposed stingless bees Tetragonisca angustula to decorated and undecorated webs placed on wooden frames. I carried out two experiments: 1) a three-frame choice, consisting of a frame bearing a decorated web, one bearing an undecorated web and a control frame without web and spider; 2) a two-frame choice, in which the bees were exposed to only two frames consisting of "decorated web vs. control," "decorated web vs. undecorated web," and "undecorated web vs. control". In favor of the prey attraction function, I found that decorated webs intercepted more bees than webs deprived of the decoration or controls with no webs. Argiope savignyi's decorations might lure prey to the web by UV-reflectance as it has been suggested for other Argiope species.

Platt, Lindsay Burnside, Elizabeth Bush	The Journal of Parasitology	95	3	2009-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 512-516	The American Society of Parasitologists	fla		Trematode cercariae inhabit predictable environments and respond to trigger cues with genetically fixed releaser responses when foraging for the upstream host. The effect of light and gravity on the transmission of Echinostoma caproni cercariae to Biomphalaria glabrata was investigated experimentally. Transmission chambers were constructed of clear polyvinyl chloride pipe. Snails were constrained within the chamber to prevent movement, while permitting the cercariae to swim freely. A trial consisted of 2 infected B. glabrata shedding E. caproni cercariae placed at the center of the chamber, with 5 uninfected B. glabrata placed 10 cm on either side (or above and below) of the shedding snails as sentinels. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of infection sentinel snails in either experiment (light vs. dark or top vs. bottom); however, mean intensity was significantly higher in sentinel snails in the dark portion of the chamber (42.5 vs. 10.4; P = 0.001) and the top of the transmission chamber (66.1 vs. 38.0; P = 0.0003). There was a high correlation between the number of metacercariae collected from sentinel snails and the total number of infective units (metacercariae + unsuccessful cercariae): r = 0.992 (light vs. dark) and r = 0.957 (top vs. bottom), respectively, at cercariae densities estimated from 22 to 3,304/L. The results suggest that cercariae of E. caproni exhibit negative photo- and geotaxis in searching for a second intermediate host. Stereotypical releaser responses to environmental trigger cues (light and gravity) allow E. caproni cercariae to exploit flexible strategies for completing the life cycle consistent with the broad range second intermediate and definitive hosts used by E. caproni cercariae and adults, respectively.

Nick	Biometrics	53	1	1997-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 49-59	International Biometric Society	fla		We are often faced with the statistical problem of evaluating the effect of a treatment in the extreme of a population. This requires taking measurements on truncated random variables and, hence, it becomes necessary to take proper account of the effect of regression toward the mean. The usual statistical procedures are inappropriate for testing treatment effect in the presence of regression toward the mean. Likelihood ratio and score tests based on truncated distributions should provide valid statistical inferences in these situations. We conducted simulation studies to investigate the properties of these methods and found that the likelihood ratio test performs well even when the sample size is moderate, whereas the score test does not seem to control the nominal significance level. We compared the likelihood ratio test to a regression-based t-test, assuming the mean of the baseline distribution to be known, and found the likelihood ratio test more powerful. In the case where the baseline mean is unknown, we also investigated Wald's test and compared it with the likelihood ratio test and score test with respect to validity and power using simulation. Wald's test and the score test do not control the nominal significance level unless the sample size is extremely large. Overall, the likelihood ratio test has the best performance among all the methods studied. The proposed likelihood ratio test is illustrated using an example of a cholesterol study.

I find that monitoring's incentive benefits are high when perquisite-taking is attractive to drivers, driver effort is important, and verifying drivers' actions to insurers is valuable. These results are consistent with agency theory and suggest that networking applications will raise the productivity and pay of difficult-to-evaluate workers. I also find that monitoring's benefits are disproportionately resource-allocation-related when managerial decisions are least constrained. This suggests that networking applications' monitoring capabilities raise the returns to delegation when resource allocation decisions are routine and lower them when they are not.

Canto	Financial Analysts Journal	42	1	1986-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 35-48	CFA Institute	fla		If fully implemented, a revenue-neutral modified flat tax can be expected to lower the economy-wide marginal tax rate and thus accelerate economic growth. Its effects on particular industry groups, however, will be moderated by the elimination of the investment tax credit (ITC) and the lengthening of depreciation schedules--two proposals shared by all three major versions of the modified flat tax. Industries, which currently face different effective tax rates because of provisions for accelerated depreciation and the ITC, may be expected to experience substantial shifts in relative performance. To determine which industries are likely to benefit the most from the tax reform package, industries must be categorized according to the ease with which they can vary production in response to shifting demand (their elasticity) and according to their sensitivity to changes in the tax on capital. Because the modified flat tax is expected to raise the effective marginal tax rate on capital relative to labor income, industries with low capital tax sensitivity (low CATS) should outperform those with high CATS. The analysis suggests certain portfolio strategies for a modified flat tax environment. In particular, low CATS industries should outperform high CATS industries. Within the group of inelastic industries, low CATS industries should outperform high CATS industries. Within the elastic industries, low CATS industries should outperform high CATS industries. Within the low CATS industries, the inelastic industries should outperform the elastic industries. Within the high CATS industries, elastic industries should outperform inelastic industries.

In particular, attention is focused on order-restricted inference. We show that the power bias model is an example of the density ratio model, or in other words, it is a semiparametric model that is specified by assuming that the ratio of several unknown probability density functions has a parametric form. Estimation and testing procedures under constraints are developed in detail. It is shown that the power bias model can be used for testing for, or against, the likelihood ratio ordering among multiple populations without resorting to any parametric assumptions. Examples and real data analysis demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.

Consequently, this study develops the concept of accommodation and studies its impact on the behavior of the USA and Soviet Union. Using COPDAB and WEIS data, this study tests a probit model and employs the derived parameters to calculate accommodative thresholds for the USA and Soviet Union towards their full set of interaction partners in the 1948-78 period and each other in the 1948-91 period. It concludes that both the USA and Soviet Union displayed accommodative tendencies, especially when a prior pattern of cooperation with a target was in place but that the USA was highly prone towards accommodation. The USA accommodated conflictive acts of varying intensity, from a wide range of states, under a variety of conditions, over lengthy time periods. The USA also accommodated conflict from the Soviet Union over long time periods in which the Soviets did not share the US penchant for accommodation. These findings generally support realist arguments that a preponderant position allows states to ignore low-level challenges from adversaries. They also provide some support for those who adopt foreign-policy approaches.

We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.

Shykoff	American Journal of Botany	92	5	2005-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 896-900	Botanical Society of America	fla		Females of gynodioecious species need to have reproductive advantages to compensate for their lack of male function and assure their maintenance in natural populations. Females may be more fecund than hermaphrodites because they reallocate resources from male to female function, avoid selfing and inbreeding depression, or produce higher quality offspring by screening arriving pollen better. A novel type of female advantage is proposed that may be important for several species of gynodioecious Caryophyllaceae. The anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum generally sterilizes its infected hosts but even without infection, spore deposition can negatively affect the reproduction of healthy individuals. In Gypsophila repens, flowers of hermaphrodite plants experimentally pollinated with both fungal spores and pollen produced significantly fewer fruits and seeds than those that received pollen alone, whereas female reproduction was unaffected by spore deposition. This unexplored reproductive advantage of females is probably due to the larger stigmatic surface in pistillate flowers, that allows pollen germination despite the presence of spores. Because longer stigmas may also lead to increased spore deposition, these results raise questions regarding the infection probability for each sex, possible sex-specific defense mechanisms, and the general role of pathogens in the maintenance of females in natural gynodioecious populations.

In reviewing earlier research, we found inconsistencies from study to study and conducted a meta-analysis to attempt an empirical integration of this literature. Overall, we found that instructor expressiveness had a substantial impact on student ratings but a small impact on student achievement. In contrast, lecture content had a substantial impact on student achievement but a small impact on student ratings. We discuss these findings and offer a new interpretation of the implications of the educational seduction literature for the validity of student ratings.

Severs	Ecological Applications	6	3	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 899-909	Ecological Society of America	fla		Dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) are parasitic plants that are widely distributed in coniferous forests of the northern hemisphere. Because the effects of dwarf mistletoes on their host trees include stunted growth, reduced seed production, and death, these mistletoes may have a substantial influence on forest structure. Studies of the effects of dwarf mistletoe on forest communities have focused primarily on their influence on timber production. We studied the effects of southwestern ponderosa pine dwarf mistletoe (A. vaginatum) on the abundance and diversity of bird communities in central Colorado. Four stands, which ranged in level of mistletoe infestation from none to heavy, were selected at each of two locations. Each stand was surveyed approximately once per week during the avian breeding seasons of 1989 and 1990 by spot mapping. The number of bird registrations and bird species richness were positively correlated with the level of dwarf mistletoe, and this pattern was consistent among 24 of 28 avian species. No species had a significant negative correlation with the level of dwarf mistletoe. The relative abundance of bird species (i.e., evenness) did not differ among stands. The number of cavity-nesting birds detected also was positively correlated with both dwarf-mistletoe levels and number of snags. The number of snags and dwarf-mistletoe levels also were highly correlated. Most snags had been infected as live trees by dwarf mistletoe and the mistletoe probably contributed to their death. While dwarf mistletoe has traditionally been viewed as a forest pest because of reductions in timber volume, we suggest that in areas where management goals are not strictly focused on timber production, control of dwarf mistletoe may not be justified, practical, or even desirable. Our data suggest that dwarf mistletoes may have positive influence on wildlife habitat. Consequently, we suggest that eradication efforts be reconsidered given that dwarf mistletoes have been a part of these forest ecosystems for thousands, and possibly millions, of years.

The aim was to outline the main characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients in French hospitals. HBV-HIV co-infected patients (85 % were receiving HAART; mean CD4 count 447 ± 245/µl, HIV RNA load < 400 copies/ml, 67 % of patients), compared to HIV-negative patients, were more often male, injecting drug users, HBeAg-positive and HCV-HIV co-infected (P < 10⁻⁴). They underwent liver biopsy less olten (31 % vs. 51 %, P < 10⁻⁴), particularly those with severe immunodeficiency. They received anti-HBV treatment more often (75 % vs. 45·7%, P < 10⁻⁴), mainly lamivudine and tenofovir. Significant improvements in the management of such patients are awaited mainly in the appraisal of liver disease by either liver biopsy or non-invasive alternatives to liver biopsy.

This question, of fundamental importance in the fields of politics, policy implementation, public administration, and public management, motivates the systematic study of governance. In this article, we present a logic of governance, based in political economy literatures, that might be used as a first step toward framing theory-based governance research. We also describe a methodological approach that is more likely to appropriately identify and explain relationships in governance regimes that involve activities and interactions that span more than one level of an organization or systemic structure. In addition, we explore the potential of various sources of data for governance research, recognizing that governance researchers will inevitably have to make simplifying assumptions or measure crudely things that we know are much more complex. We argue that when appropriately framed and interpreted through a logic of governance that acknowledges limitations attributable to the models, methods, and data employed, governance research is more likely to produce enduring knowledge about how, why, and with what consequences public-sector activity is structured and managed.

Immediately upon entering a teachers' college and beginning teaching as part of an internship model of teacher education, they perceived that as far as the credentialling authority was concerned, becoming a teacher meant discarding the idea that they were tradespersons. Initially this created a feeling of astonishment and shock followed by anger and anxiety, then denial of the challenge. Their expectation of the teaching role (narrow vocationalism) was under question, an uneasy and reluctant acceptance followed and this remained their perception for the rest of the two-year course. They sustained intense anger at the teachers' college for the duration of the course and attempted to cope as best they could. The central purpose of this article is to examine how the cohort used humour as a coping strategy when faced with a substantial threat to their occupational self-identity.

Three of the peptides corresponded to overlapping regions of the N-terminal half of E7 protein; the other peptides corresponded to selected regions of E2, E4, LI, and L2 proteins. The prevalence of antibodies against E2 and E7 peptides was significantly different between patients and controls. The most marked differences were for E7 peptides. HPV DNA polymerase chain reaction diagnoses of cervical scrapes were available; these were correlated with serologic findings. In HPV-16 DNA-positive patients, E7 antibodies were more broadly and more strongly reactive than in other patient groups.

Quoted industrial prices are apparently such a series. It has been observed that when market conditions change, quoted prices are not revised immediately. This delay operates more strongly against reductions in price quotations than against increases. A statistical model for such asymmetric times series is developed and analyzed. An estimation procedure is given as well as a statistical test of the hypothesis of symmetry versus the alternative of asymmetry. Asymmetric time series models are fit to several economic time series.

Mitchison	The Journal of Cell Biology	112	5	1991-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 925-940	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		We have used Xenopus egg extracts to study spindle morphogenesis in a cell-free system and have identified two pathways of spindle assembly in vitro using methods of fluorescent analogue cytochemistry. When demembranated sperm nuclei are added to egg extracts arrested in a mitotic state, individual nuclei direct the assembly of polarized microtubule arrays, which we term half-spindles; half-spindles then fuse pairwise to form bipolar spindles. In contrast, when sperm nuclei are added to extracts that are induced to enter interphase and arrested in the following mitosis, a single sperm nucleus can direct the assembly of a complete spindle. We find that microtubule arrays in vitro are strongly biased towards chromatin, but this does not depend on specific kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Indeed, although we have identified morphological and probably functional kinetochores in spindles assembled in vitro, kinetochores appear not to play an obligate role in the establishment of stable, bipolar microtubule arrays in either assembly pathway. Features of the two pathways suggest that spindle assembly involves a hierarchy of selective microtubule stabilization, involving both chromatin-microtubule interactions and antiparallel microtubule-microtubule interactions, and that fundamental molecular interactions are probably the same in both pathways. This in vitro reconstitution system should be useful for identifying the molecules regulating the generation of asymmetric microtubule arrays and for understanding spindle morphogenesis in general.

Jones	American Journal of Political Science	46	1	2002-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 218-237	Midwest Political Science Association	fla		Multilevel data are structures that consist of multiple units of analysis, one nested within the other. Such data are becoming quite common in political science and provide numerous opportunities for theory testing and development. Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a number of statistical problems, of which clustering is particularly important. To exploit the opportunities offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that has become popular in educational statistics and sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis, researchers build models that capture the layered structure of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in this article is to introduce the logic and statistical theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel analysis.

The equating methods developed are compared with previously developed methods to which they are similar. By developing explicit models for the problem, insight is gained into the assumptions required for its solution.

Scientists selectively employ different cultural strategies with regards to the religion-science relationship: redefining categories (the use of institutional resources from religion and from science), integration models (scientists strategically employ the views of major scientific actors to legitimate a more symbiotic relationship between science and religion), and intentional talk (scientists actively engage in discussions about the boundaries between science and religion). Such results challenge narrow conceptions of secularization theory and the sociology of science literature by describing ways science intersects with other knowledge categories. Most broadly the ways that institutions and ideologies shape one another through the agency of individual actors within those institutions is explored.

Design—Retrospective analysis of pooled data from 17 double blind clinical trials in patients with major depressive disorder comparing fluoxetine (n=1765) with a tricyclic antidepressant (n=731) or placebo (n=569), or both. Main outcome measures—Multiple data sources were searched to identify patients with suicidal acts. Suicidal ideation was assessed with item 3 of the Hamilton depression rating scale, which systematically rates suicidality. Emergence of substantial suicidal ideation was defined as a change in the rating of this item from 0 or 1 at baseline to 3 or 4 during double blind treatment; worsening was defined as any increase from baseline; improvement was defined as a decrease from baseline at the last visit during the treatment. Results—Suicidal acts did not differ significantly in comparisons of fluoxetine with placebo (0.2% v 0.2%, p=0.494, Mantel-Haenszel adjusted incidence difference) and with tricyclic antidepressants (0.7% v 0.4%, p=0.419). The pooled incidence of suicidal acts was 0.3% for fluoxetine, 0.2% for placebo, and 0.4% for tricyclic antidepressants, and fluoxetine did not differ significantly from either placebo (p=0.533, Pearson's ϰ²) or tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.789). Suicidal ideation emerged marginally significantly less often with fluoxetine than with placebo (0.9% v 2.6%, p=0.094) and numerically less often than with tricyclic antidepressants (1.7% v 3.6%, p=0.102). The pooled incidence of emergence of substantial suicidal ideation was 1.2% for fluoxetine, 2.6% for placebo, and 3.6% for tricyclic antidepressants. The incidence was significantly lower with fluoxetine than with placebo (p=0.042) and tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.001). Any degree of worsening of suicidal ideation was similar with fluoxetine and placebo (15.4%v17.9%, p=0.196) and with fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants (15.6% v 16.3%, p=0.793). The pooled incidence of worsening of suicidal ideation was 15.3% for fluoxetine, 17.9% for placebo, and 16.3% for tricyclic antidepressants. The incidence did not differ significantly with fluoxetine and placebo (p=0.141) or tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.542). Suicidal ideation improved significantly more with fluoxetine than with placebo (72.0% v 54.8%, p<0.001) and was similar to the improvement with tricyclic antidepressants (72.5% v 69.8%, p=0.294). The pooled incidence of improvement of suicidal ideation was 72.2% for fluoxetine, 54.8% for placebo, and 69.8% for tricyclic antidepressants. The incidence with fluoxetine was significantly greater than with placebo (p<0.001) and did not differ from that with tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.296). Conclusion—Data from these trials do not show that fluoxetine is associated with an increased risk of suicidal acts or emergence of substantial suicidal thoughts among depressed patients.

Mansfield	International Organization	58	4	2004-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 775-805	Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation, The MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press	fla		The "new" trade theory and standard trade theory make different predictions about the composition and distribution of trade flows. Empirical evidence suggests that an increasing share of international trade consists of differentiated products, a consequence of increasing returns to scale. Nonetheless, the existing political science literature typically assumes that the conditions of standard theory hold. As such, the literature ignores the dynamic-inconsistency problem that imperfect markets can create. In doing so, it also ignores the fact that imperfect markets can shift the political prerequisites of open international markets. In this article we examine these shifts. We argue that alliances can support an optimal level of trade when scale economies rather than differences in relative factor endowments motivate it. Our empirical results support this argument, indicating that alliances exert a stronger influence on trade in goods produced under conditions of increasing rather than constant returns to scale.

I argue that democratic transitions are an important cause of foreign-policy realignment with the United States and, furthermore, that the nature of that realignment is conditioned by whether the United States supported the previous nondemocratic regime. American support, or lack thereof, for the ancien régime structures the domestic politics of democratic transitions. In the absence of previous U.S. support, democratization commonly leads to positive foreign-policy realignment toward the United States. Conversely, when the United States supports nondemocratic regimes, democratic transitions rarely produce positive realignment. I use an original data set of country—year dyads with the United States from 1950 to 2000. Using Markov Transition regression models, I find that the interaction of democratic transition and previous U.S. support is a powerful determinant of foreign-policy realignment. This research has important implications for international relations theory and American foreign policy.

Rosenblum	American Bar Foundation Research Journal	5	1	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-30	American Bar Foundation, Wiley	fla		The competence of the practicing bar has been subjected to substantial criticism in recent years. Since law schools have a virtual monopoly over access to the bar and licensure is granted without further training, legal education has been a particular focus of attack and reform efforts. Yet there has been little systematic study of what skills and knowledge are important in the actual practice of law or the relevant contributions of legal education. This study of practicing lawyers in Chicago examines the nature of the competencies important to the practice of law and the sources lawyers credit for contributing to their development. Practitioners cite a broad range of skills, many of them not unique to the practice of law, with their importance varying by the predominant legal specialty practiced. The data further indicate that law schools play but a part in the development of skills and knowledge important to the practice of law and that experience, both prior and subsequent to graduation, plays a significant role. The evaluation of law schools' contributions is related to opportunities for further training, particularly in the context of law firm practice. There is, however, a strong general view that law schools rather uniformly concentrate on some skills to the exclusion of others and that the former are not necessarily those that lawyers think are most important to the practice of law.

Haine, Jérémie Beguet, Guenaël Martin, Loïc Bollache, Ilona B. Muskó, Dirk Platvoet, Thierry Rigaud	Oikos	116	11	2007-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1941-1953	Nordic Society Oikos, Wiley	fla		Understanding what factors determine the success of an invasive species in its adopted range is crucial from an evolutionary ecology point of view, because it can provide insights into which biological characteristics are required for survival in varied environmental conditions. Successful establishment may depend on both maintaining genetic diversity, which will allow the species to evolve and/or adapt to new environments, and the presence or absence of natural enemies such as parasites. We tested these two hypotheses by studying populations of the amphipod crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus. This Ponto-Caspian invader has rapidly and successfully invaded western Europe and threatens macroinvertebrate biodiversity in its adopted ranges. It is a unique system to study since both its colonisation history and its geographic origins are well-known. Using samples from the whole geographic range of the invasion route, and using four molecular markers, we found no evidence for genetic bottlenecks during the invasion of D. villosus in western Europe, despite slight variations in allelic proportions according to spatio-temporal subdivisions of our dataset. In addition, we analysed the prevalence and diversity of parasites across its native and adopted range. We found no macro-parasites, and no significant parasite loss of microsporidian parasites during the invasive process. Our data suggest that D. villosus invasion was either massive, or recurrent, or both, allowing a parasitic cortege to follow the host. The maintenance of genetic diversity may have contributed to its success, including the variation in resistance in the face of the natural enemies.

It identifies a number of often overlapping causes for the housing dilemmas of low income families, including outright inability to pay, landlord intransigence to families with children and evictions, illness, overcrowding, deprived housing conditions, racism and social factors within the family. It aims to make a contribution to a growing body of work that complicates accepted notions of post-war prosperity and the benefits of the welfare state for low-income earners in advanced capitalist countries. The first section is based on adaptations of various statistical indicators of housing hardship generated by researchers for Toronto's public housing administration as well as analyses by social agencies, contemporary observers and recent scholarly research. It briefly looks at pre-World War II developments and then chronicles housing need from the 1940s to the 1990s. Various methods and databases were used in these studies and rarely did they originally attempt to chart processes over time. Nevertheless, we can make a reasonable assumption that this information offers us sound indications, if not exact measures, of the housing difficulties faced by low-income families. The second section of the article elucidates the informative if partial statistical record of housing need by considering various qualitative sources such as oral testimony, tenant correspondence and other documentary voices of low-income families. My interests in exploring this subject emanated from a larger study of Regent Park (RP) in Toronto, Canada's first and largest rent-geared-to-income housing project. The archival records, which contain numerous letters from prospective tenants and rare resident case files, and the interviews I conducted with former tenants of RP, speak directly to the question of housing need. I use the evidence both of families that secured places in RP and of prospective tenants who expressed a need for state assistance. By no means does this exhaust the low-income housing experience in Toronto but it provides readily accessible qualitative evidence to explore the question of housing hardship in the post-war era. The article thus highlights individual accounts of housing hardship, allowing us to put a much-needed human face on those left out of the much-vaunted, post-war "age of prosperity."

Monetary Transmission in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary	Dejan Krušec	Eastern European Economics	49	1	2011-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 52-71	M.E. Sharpe, Inc.	fla		This paper estimates the monetary transmission mechanisms in four inflation-targeting new EU members: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland. We use a structural vector error-correction model to identify the monetary shock with long-run restrictions. We find that a restrictive monetary shock has a significant negative effect on the inflation rate in all the countries considered. In response to a one-percentage-point shock in the nominal interest rate, inflation falls by half to one percentage point and returns to steady state after four to six months. Therefore, inflation targeting is likely to be an effective strategy on these countries' way to join the European Monetary Union. The policy might also be a relevant option for future EU member states.

One is for papers of a general nature and the other specifically for reports on clinical trials. Each check list includes questions on the design, conduct, analysis, and presentation of studies, and answers to these contribute to the overall statistical evaluation. Only a small proportion of submitted papers are assessed statistically, and these are selected at the refereeing or editorial stage. Examination of the use of the check lists showed that most papers contained statistical failings, many of which could easily be remedied. It is recommended that the check lists should be used by statistical referees, editorial staff, and authors and also during the design stage of studies.

Radiat. Res. Ill, 219-224 (2009). Low-or intermediate-dose y radiation appears to have the capacity to ameliorate certain types of diseases, including allergic conditions, when examined under specific exposure conditions and with specific animal models, though the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be fully clarified. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of intermediate- dose 7 radiation by examining its effects on the activation state of p38 MAPK and the production of cytokines in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Dephosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was observed at 15 min after irradiation (0.5-1 Gy from a  $^{137} {\rm{Cs}}$   source) concomitant with a significant increase in the expression of MKP-1, which dephosphorylates ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Since activated p38 MAPK mediates TNF-α production, we examined the effect of radiation on LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPK and TNF-a production. The activation of p38 MAPK and production of TNF-a induced by LPS treatment were both suppressed in preirradiated cells. LPS-induced production of TNF-α was enhanced by knockdown of MKP-1. These results indicate that 0.5 Gy 7 radiation would cause up-regulation of MKP-1, leading to inactivation of p38 MAPK and suppression of TNF-α production, in cells of mouse macrophages cell line.

All bacterial strains were susceptible to the antibiotic. No differences were found with respect to efficacy. Therapy for bacteremia failed in two M patients, but bacteria persisted in 17 (10 S, 7 M) at the primary infection site. In 12 there was an anatomic or physiologic factor contributing to this persistence. One S patient showed mild nephrotoxicity, but ototoxicity was not found in any of the 35 patients who underwent serial audiography. Mild reversible rises of transaminases were found in 5 of 35 S patients and in 3 of 34 M patients. Once-daily administration of netilmicin seems to be as effective and as safe as conventional multiple daily doses.

Jackman	The American Political Science Review	81	2	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 405-424	American Political Science Association	fla		Differences in voter turnout among industrial democracies are a function of political institutions and electoral law. Specifically, the presence of nationally competitive electoral districts provides incentives for parties and candidates to mobilize voters everywhere, thereby increasing turnout. Disproportionality in the translation of votes into legislative seats provides a disincentive to voting, which lowers turnout. Multipartyism assigns elections a less decisive role in government formation, depressing turnout. By generating more decisive governments, unicameralism provides a clearer link between elections and legislation, increasing turnout. Finally, mandatory voting laws produce a disincentive to not vote. Empirical analyses of average voter-turnout levels in the 1970s and 1960s across 19 democracies are consistent with these expectations, although Switzerland and the United States appear to be outliers. The results have major implications for the way we interpret national differences in voter-turnout rates.

We have used this approach to study a group of patients (n = 7) infected with HIV and clinical manifestations of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC), a group of patients (n = 8) infected with HIV without any indications of ADC, and seven controls. The patients without ADC had a statistically significant increase in the ratio of myo-inositol to creatine in white matter compared with normal controls. In contrast, the group of patients with ADC had almost normal levels of myo-inositol to creatine in both gray matter and white matter and showed a statistically significant decrease in the N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio in gray matter compared with either the normal controls or the patients without ADC. Patterns of spectral abnormalities correlated with neuropsychological measures of frontal lobe dysfunction, suggesting that the evaluation of frontal lobe metabolism by magnetic resonance spectroscopy can play a role in the early detection of ADC, in determining its progression, and in assessing responses to therapeutic interventions.

The program also provides analytical tools for the assessment of geometric constraints in empirical datasets for one-dimensional domains (transects). The mid-domain effect (MDE) is the increasing overlap of species ranges towards the center of a shared, bounded domain due to geometric boundary constraints in relation to the distribution of range sizes, producing a peak or plateau of species richness towards the center of the domain. Domains may be spatial, temporal, or functional. RangeModel is a stand-alone, graphical-interface, freeware application for PC and Mac OS platforms.

However, their precise biological role remains largely elusive. In the present study, we aimed to identify microRNA species involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we demonstrated that miR-34a was highly up-regulated in a human colon cancer cell line, HCT 116, treated with a DNA-damaging agent, adriamycin. Transient introduction of miR-34a into two human colon cancer cell lines, HCT 116 and RKO, caused complete suppression of cell proliferation and induced senescencelike phenotypes. Moreover, miR-34a also suppressed in vivo growth of HCT 116 and RKO cells in tumors in mice when complexed and administered with atelocollagen for drug delivery. Gene-expression microarray and immunoblot analyses revealed down-regulation of the E2F pathway by miR-34a introduction. Up-regulation of the p53 pathway was also observed. Furthermore, 9 of 25 human colon cancers (36%) showed decreased expression of miR-34a compared with counterpart normal tissues. Our results provide evidence that miR-34a functions as a potent suppressor of cell proliferation through modulation of the E2F signaling pathway. Abrogation of miR-34a function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation, leading to colon cancer development.

Dale, Robert Plomin	Child Development	80	3	2009-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 662-673	Society for Research in Child Development, Wiley	fla		During childhood and adolescence, increases in heritability and decreases in shared environmental influences have typically been found for cognitive abilities. A sample of more than 2,500 pairs of twins from the Twins Early Development Study was used to investigate whether a similar pattern would be found for science performance from 9 to 12 years. Science performance was based on teacher-assessed U.K. National Curriculum standards. Science at 9 years showed high heritability (64%) and modest shared environmental (16%) estimates. In contrast to the expected developmental pattern, heritability was significantly lower at 12 years (47%) and shared environmental influences were significantly higher (32%). Understanding what these increasingly important shared environmental influences are could lead to interventions that encourage engagement in science throughout the lifespan.

Donoghue	Paleobiology	19	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 141-167	Paleontological Society	fla		Approaches to patterns of diversification based on counting taxa at a given rank can be misleading, even when all taxa are monophyletic. Such "rank-based" approaches are unable to reflect a hierarchy of evolutionary events because taxa of the same rank cannot be nested within one another. Phylogenetic trees specify an order of origination of characters and clades and can therefore be used in some cases to test hypotheses on causal relationships between characters and changes in diversity. "Tree-thinking" also clarifies discussions of the age of groups, by distinguishing between splitting of the stem-lineage from its sister group and splitting of the crown-group into extant clades. Cladistic evidence that Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and Gnetales are the sister group of angiosperms implies that the angiosperm line (angiophytes) existed by the Late Triassic. The presence of primitive members of five basic angiosperm clades indicates that the crown-group (angiosperms) had begun to diversify by the mid-Early Cretaceous (Barremian-Aptian), but not necessarily much earlier. The greatest unresolved issue raised by cladistic analyses concerns the fact that the angiosperm tree can be rooted in two almost equally parsimonious positions. Trees rooted near Magnoliales (among "woody magnoliids") suggest that the angiosperm radiation may have been triggered by the origin of intrinsic traits, e.g., a fast-growing, rhizomatous habit in the paleoherb and eudicot subgroup. However, trees rooted among paleoherbs, which are favored by rRNA data, imply that these traits are basic for angiosperms as a whole. This could mean that the crown-group originated not long before its radiation, or, if it did originate earlier, that its radiation was delayed due to extrinsic factors. Such factors could be a trend from environmental homogeneity and stability in the Jurassic to renewed tectonic activity and disturbance in the Early Cretaceous. Potentially relevant pre-Cretaceous fossils cannot be placed with confidence, but may be located along the stem-lineage (stem angiophytes); their generally paleoherb-like features favor the paleoherb rooting. The history of angiophytes may parallel that of Gnetales: some diversification of the stem-lineage in the Late Triassic, near disappearance in the Jurassic, and vigorous radiation of the crown-group in the Early Cretaceous.

Tayeb	Journal of Organizational Behavior	14	3	1993-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 251-267	Wiley	fla		Scaling and convergent validity findings are provided for indices derived from English translations of performance (P) and Maintenance (M) field measures of leadership used for production employees in Japanese manufacturing organizations (Misumi, 1985; Misumi and Peterson, 1985). LISREL confirmatory factor analyses indicate some weaknesses in the measures ordinarily used. Item analyses using seven items from the Ohio State scales indicate that the English version of the Japanese 'maintenance' leadership function measure is very similar to the Ohio State 'Consideration' measure. The measures of two aspects of the 'Performance' function-Planning-P and Pressure-P-show differences from items often used to measure various aspects of Initiating Structure. Regressions reported for two electronics assembly plants (one British and one U.S.) show relationships partially consistent with usual Japanese results for group process/attitude descriptions by subordinates, but not for performance. Results for performance ratings by superiors show that experiencing the M function from a superior is positively associated with two or three aspects of rated performance at one site. Pressuring leadership is negatively related to interpersonal cooperation at both sites. The results suggest that field research using English versions of the PM measures is likely to produce different results than research using manly measures based on the Ohio State tradition. Revisions needed in PM measures and methods to take advantage of the theory's basis insights and to integrate it with Western research are discussed

The authors' analysis of the 1988 two-per-thousand fertility survey indicates that the high sex ratios occur especially among third and higher order births conceived outside local birth plans under China's stringent one-child family planning policy. Adoptions are estimated to account for about half of the missing girls. Some girls whose births went unreported are presumably living with their parents, but the inability to estimate the size of this phenomenon hampers estimates of female infanticide. Excess female infant mortality is postulated at about 39,000 per year, or about 4 infant deaths per thousand live-born girls.

Results show that the choice of method and the selection of a mean or median estimator for the open-ended category midpoint have substantial effects on analyses in which income is the dependent variable. The accuracy of the two methods is evaluated in simulations using exact income data, and recommendations based on these evaluations are presented.

With application to Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, we first employ a gravity equation to break down each region's export performance, separating the contribution of foreign market access from internal supply capacity. Then, we identify the key determinants of countries' export performance, both theoretically and empirically. Our contribution is to introduce demand spillovers that help market access to improve supply conditions. Regression reveals a positive interaction between the two components, with a higher elasticity of exports with respect to market access in the particular case of South-South trade flows.

Chang, Yun-han Chu	The Journal of Politics	68	2	2006-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 259-271	Cambridge University Press, Southern Political Science Association	fla		While voluminous studies have attributed the continuing decline of institutional trust to political corruption, the link between corruption and institutional trust in Asia has yet to be explored systematically. Testing the effect of corruption on institutional trust is theoretically important and empirically challenging, since many suggest that contextual factors in Asia, such as political culture and electoral politics, might neutralize the negative impact of corruption. Utilizing data from the East Asia Barometer, we find a strong trust-eroding effect of political corruption in Asian democracies. We also find no evidence that contextual factors lessen the corruption-trust link in Asia. The trust-eroding effect holds uniformly across all countries examined in this study and remains robust even after taking into account the endogenous relationship between corruption and trust.

'Real' and 'bogus' UPE are distinguished and the alternative concept of basic education considered. Implementation of UPE, an immensely demanding undertaking, requires adequate information, genuine commitment and close co-operation - at all levels and from all concerned; equally, it depends on administrative ability, organization of training, and political motivation, flexibility and sincerity. Recognising the demands and costs of UPE, the reasons for commitment to it are examined (and illustrated from the case of Nigeria) - and the feasibility of successful implementation, e.g., by the year 2000, assessed. Alternatives exist, both in concept and practice, but seem unlikely to commend themselves. Nevertheless, as is stressed in the articles, lessons may be learned from experience already gained concerning the effectiveness of such factors as: greater community involvement in providing and controlling schools; more emphasis on school health; closer relationships between central and local planning; alternative structures for older learners or drop-outs; the shortening of instructional time; and increased research and greater investment in training for the teaching of basic skills at primary level. Without a radical change of attitude, particularly with respect to this last priority, efforts to achieve even literacy, the first goal of UPE, are being seriously undermined. /// In seiner Einleitung zu dieser Sondernummer zeigt der Gastherausgeber die verschiedenen Definitionen des Begriffes des 'Weltweiten Ausbaus des Primarschulwesens' auf, die auch in den Beiträgen dieser Ausgabe gebraucht werden. Danach erläutert er die Bedeutung dieser Vielfalt im Rahmen der Bemühungen der Staaten, dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Es wird zwischen 'echten' und 'gefälschten' Konzepten des weltweiten Ausbaus des Primarschulwesens unterschieden und die Alternative eines Konzepts der Elementarerziehung wird erwogen. Die Durchführung des weltweiten Ausbaus des Primarschulwesens - ein überaus anspruchsvolles Unternehmen - erfordert angemessene Information, wahres Engagement und eine enge Zusammenarbeit auf allen Ebenen und von allen Betroffenen; sie hängt gleichermaßen von administrativen Fähigkeiten, der Organisation der Ausbildung sowie politischer Motivation, als auch Flexibilität und Ernsthaftigkeit ab. Die Nachfragen und Kosten des weltweiten Ausbaus der Primarerziehung werden erkannt, die Gründe für ein entsprechendes Engagement werden untersucht (und an Hand des Beispiels von Nigerien illustriert) - und es wird geprüft, ob sich dieses Ziel bis zum Jahre 2000 erfolgreich durchführen läßt. Alternativen bestehen zwar, sowohl als Konzept wie auch in Praxis, aber es erscheint unwahrscheinlich, daß sie sich anbieten. Wie in den Berichten betont wird, kann aus der gewonnenen Erfahrung, die die Wirksamkeit solcher Faktoren betrifft, dennoch dieses gelernt werden: ein größeres Maß an Beteiligung des Gemeinwesens, indem Schulen vorgesehen und beaufsichtigt werden; mehr Betonung auf Schulgesundheitspflege; engere Beziehung zur zentralen und lokalen Planung; alternative Strukturen für ältere Lernende oder Schulversager; Kürzungen der Unterrichtszeit; mehr Untersuchungen und größere Investitionen in der Ausbildung für das Unterrichten der elementaren Fähigkeiten auf der Primarebene. Wenn sich die Einstellung nicht durchgreifend ändert - ganz besonders in Hinblick auf die letztgenannten Prioritäten - werden Bemühungen, die Alphabetisierung durchzuführen - das oberste Ziel des weltweiten Ausbaus des Primarschulwesens - ernsthaft gefährdet werden. /// Dans la présentation de ce Numéro Spécial, son éditeur identifie les différents usages du terme 'EPU' qui se reflètent aussi dans les contributions à ce Numéro, et il envisage la portée et les conséquences de cette diversité dans le contexte des efforts des nations pour y parvenir. Il établit une distinction entre EPU réel et EPU factice. Il examine aussi le concept de l'enseignement de base. L'accomplissement de l'EPU est une entreprise incroyablement exigeante qui réclame une documentation adéquate, un engagement authentique et une coopération étroite, à tous les niveaux, de tous ceux que cela concerne. Il est aussi tributaire des compétences administratives, de l'organisation de la formation, de la motivation politique, de la souplesse et de la sincérité. Le coût et la demande de l'EPU étant reconnus, on examine, dans ce Numéro, les raisons de s'engager dans l'entreprise (en prenant comme exemple illustratif le cas du Nigeria) - et on évalue les chances d'une réalisation couronnée de succès pour l'an 2000. Il existe d'autres choix, tant dans le concept que dans la pratique, mais ils n'ont guère de chance de s'imposer. Néanmoins, comme cela est souligné dans des articles ultérieurs, on peut tirer des leçons de l'expérience déjà acquise quant à l'efficacité de certains facteurs tels que: participation plus importante de la collectivité aux besoins et au contrôle des établissements scolaires; attention supérieure accordée à l'hygiène scolaire; relations plus étroites entre la planification locale et la planification centrale; choix d'options de structures ouvert aux apprenants plus âgés ou à ceux qui ont quitté l'école; raccourcissement du temps d'enseignement; recherche et investissement accrus concernant la formation indispensable à l'enseignement des connaissances fondamentales au niveau du primaire. Sans un changement radical d'attitude, particulièrement en ce qui regarde cette dernière priorité, les efforts pour parvenir à une alphabétisation générale - objectif premier de l'EPU - sont sérieusement sapés dans leurs fondements mêmes.

It was hypothesized that these ventures, in which a new organizational entity was formed, were a form of interorganizational linkage used to manage interorganizational interdependence, both competitive and symbiotic. Very large firms engaged in joint projects, and patterns of joint venture activity tended to follow the exchange of resources across industrial sectors. Examining the variation in the proportion of joint venture activities undertaken within the organization's own industry, it was found that conditions of industrial concentration, related to competitive interdependence, accounted for a significant amount of the variance. An industry-by-industry analysis showed that joint ventures were more highly related to purchase transactions interdependence to the extent the industry was highly concentrated and had a higher proportion of its employment engaged in research and development. Sales transactions interdependence accounted for more of the variance in the pattern of joint venture activities when the industry was moderately concentrated. And both sales and purchase interdependence were more highly related to joint venture activity to the extent that the industry was capital intensive.

Pannett, D. Coggon	Occupational and Environmental Medicine	59	9	2002-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 634-639	BMJ Publishing Group	fla		Aims: To determine the prevalence of self reported hearing difficulties and tinnitus in working aged people from the general population, and to estimate the risks from occupational exposure to noise and the number of attributable cases nationally. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 22 194 adults of working age selected at random from the age–sex registers of 34 British general practices (21 201 subjects) and from the central pay records of the British armed services (993 subjects). Information was collected on years of employment in a noisy job; and whether the respondent wore a hearing aid, had difficulty in hearing conversation, or had experienced persistent tinnitus over the past year. Associations of hearing difficulty and tinnitus with noise exposure were examined by logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, and frequent complaints of headaches, tiredness, or stress. The findings were expressed as prevalence ratios (PRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Attributable numbers were calculated from the relevant PRs and an estimate of the prevalence of occupational exposure to noise nationally. Results: Some 2% of subjects reported severe hearing difficulties (wearing a hearing aid or having great difficulty in both ears in hearing conversation in a quiet room). In men, the prevalence of this outcome rose steeply with age, from below 1% in those aged 16–24 years to 8% in those aged 55–64. The pattern was similar in women, but severe hearing loss was only about half as prevalent in the oldest age band. Tinnitus was far more common in subjects with hearing difficulties. In both sexes, after adjustment for age, the risk of severe hearing difficulty and persistent tinnitus rose with years spent in a noisy job. In men older than 35 years with 10 or more years of exposure, the PR for severe hearing difficulty was 3.8 (95% CI 2.4 to 6.2) and that for persistent tinnitus 2.6 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.4) in comparison with those who had never had a noisy job. Nationally, some 153 000 men and 26 000 women aged 35–64 years were estimated to have severe hearing difficulties attributable to noise at work. For persistent tinnitus the corresponding numbers were 266 000 and 84 000. Conclusions: Significant hearing difficulties and tinnitus are quite common in men from the older working age range. Both are strongly associated with years spent in a noisy occupation—a predominantly male exposure. The national burden of hearing difficulties attributable to noise at work is substantial.

Freckleton	Journal of Animal Ecology	75	5	2006-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1182-1189	British Ecological Society	fla		1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.

A convenience sample of individuals working for a university or one of several business organizations located in the Mountain West region of the United States was compiled with a self-report questionnaire. A usable sample of 143 persons representing both the public and private industries was secured for use in this study. The results of an analysis of covariance showed that reviewing ethics codes during employee orientation was positively related to individuals' beliefs that incorruptibility is an important individual virtue. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

The DME was developed specifically for this project and examines the issues surrounding aquaculture in Lough Swilly in County Donegal. The VLE allowed pupils from two geographically distant schools to have access to a range of content and communication tools. The pupils collaborated electronically within groups of four (two pupils from each school) over a period of twelve days to prepare a presentation about their decisions in relation to the case study. Levels of ICT skills, and of collaborative engagement with this DME, varied across the groups, but in both there was evidence that the process was valuable. Ways in which the project can be developed are suggested.

Beck	Southeastern Naturalist	6	3	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 535-550	Eagle Hill Institute	fla		Invasive plant species can have substantial negative impacts on native flora and fauna. We investigated the effects of the invasive shrub Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet) on the abundance and diversity of songbirds in a southeastern forest during summer, fall, and winter. We sampled 15-m x 15-m plots assigned to one of three privet density categories (low, n = 5; medium, n = 4; high, n = 5). In addition, we sampled all flora in each plot. Bird abundance and species richness varied only during the winter, both increasing in high privet density. In general, the behaviors and types of birds did not differ among privet-density categories. In contrast, abundance and richness of native plants were reduced in high privet-density plots. Our results suggest that removal of privet would improve native plant communities, while having no substantial impact on songbird populations.

I examined effects of sex, reproductive state, and body size on spatial use within a riparian habitat. Snakes inhabited a relatively linear environment, restricting movements to the vicinity of the stream. Males occupied larger home ranges than both gravid and nongravid females. Gravid females exhibited marginally larger home ranges than nongravid females, but any effects attributable to reproductive state were relatively small when compared to sex differences in spatial use. Body size was positively correlated with home-range size but did not account for observed home-range differences among population subunits.

James O'Malley	Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences	366	1874	2008-07-13T00:00:00Z	pp. 2301-2312	The Royal Society	fla		A precision profile, the relationship between the concentration of a substance and its measured precision, is a convenient way of conveying the ability of an immunoassay to accurately measure the concentration of a substance in blood serum. A precision profile is characterized by the definition of precision. Historically, precision has been evaluated as the standard error of an estimator of the concentration in a sample conditional on the true concentration. In this paper, Bayesian predictive inference is used to develop a new measure of precision based on the accuracy with which an assay could infer the concentration in a hypothetical new sample. This leads to a natural procedure for evaluating a precision profile that avoids using approximations such as those inherent in traditional methods.

If increased competition induces a switch away from these wage implicit agreements, then (1) the sensitivity of workers’ wages to the current unemployment rate should increase as competition increases and (2) the sensitivity of workers’ wages to the unemployment rate prevailing upon hire should decrease. Using exchange‐rate movements to generate exogenous variation in import competition, I find evidence supporting both of these predictions. I show that increased financial pressures on employers is one mechanism driving these effects.

Kahn	Financial Analysts Journal	56	6	2000-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 40-53	CFA Institute	fla		Long-short strategies have generated controversy and institutional interest for more than 10 years. We analyzed the efficiency gains of long-short investing, where we defined efficiency as the information ratio of the implemented strategy (the optimal portfolio) relative to the intrinsic information ratio of the alphas. The efficiency advantage of long-short investing arises from the loosening of the (surprisingly important) long-only constraint. Long-short and long-only managers need to understand the impact of this significant constraint. Long-short implementations offer the most improvement over long-only implementations when the universe of assets is large, asset volatility is low, and the strategy has high active risk. The long-only constraint induces biases (particularly toward small stocks), limits the manager's ability to act on upside information by not allowing short positions that could finance long positions, and reduces the efficiency of traditional (high-risk) long-only strategies relative to enhanced index (low-risk) long-only strategies.

Kearsley	The Condor	106	1	2004-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 106-115	Cooper Ornithological Society, University of California Press	fla		We examined diets of six insectivorous bird species (n = 202 individuals) from two vegetation zones along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, 1994. All bird species consumed similar quantities of caterpillars and beetles, but use of other prey taxa varied. Non-native leafhoppers (Opsius stactagolus) specific to non-native tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) substantially augmented Lucy's Warbler (Vermivora luciae) diets (49%), while ants comprised 82% of Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) diets. Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) diets were composed of 45% aquatic midges. All bird species consumed the non-native leafhopper specific to tamarisk. Comparison of bird diets with availability of arthropod prey from aquatic and terrestrial origins showed terrestrial insects comprised 91% of all avian diets compared to 9% of prey from aquatic origin. Seasonal shifts in arthropod prey occurred in diets of three bird species, although no seasonal shifts were detected in arthropods sampled in vegetation indicating that at least three bird species were not selecting prey in proportion to its abundance. All bird species had higher prey overlap with arthropods collected in the native, mesquite-acacia vegetation zone which contained higher arthropod diversity and better prey items (i.e., Lepidoptera). Lucy's Warbler and Yellow Warbler consumed high proportions of prey items found in greatest abundance in the tamarisk-dominated vegetation zone that has been established since the construction of Glen Canyon Dam. These species appeared to exhibit ecological plasticity in response to an anthropogenic increase in prey resources. /// Examinamos la dieta de seis especies de aves insectívoras (n = 202 individuos) de dos zonas de vegetación a lo largo del Río Colorado en el Parque Nacional del Gran Cañon, Arizona, en 1994. Todas las especies de aves consumieron cantidades similares de orugas y escarabajos, pero el uso de otras presas fue variable. Los Cicadellidae (Homóptera) exóticos (Opsius stactagolus) específicos del tamarisco exótico (Tamarix chinensis) comprendieron una parte sustancial de la dieta de Vermivora luciae (49%), mientras que las hormigas representaron el 82% de la dieta de Icteria virens. La dieta de Dendroica petechia incluyó un 45% de dípteros acuáticos de la familia Cecidomyiidae. Todas las especies de aves consumieron el cicadellide exótico específico del tamarisco. La comparación de las dietas de aves con la disponibilidad de presas de artrópodos de origen acuático y terrestre mostró que los insectos terrestres comprendieron el 91% de todas las dietas de aves, comparado con un 9% de presas de origen acuático. Se registraron cambios estacionales en los artrópodos de la dieta de tres especies de aves, aunque no se detectaron cambios estacionales en los artrópodos muestreados en la vegetación, indicando que al menos tres especies de aves no estuvieron seleccionando las presas en proporción a su abundancia. Todas las especies de aves presentaron mayor superposición de presas con los artrópodos colectados en la zona de vegetación nativa de mesquite (Prosopis) y Acacia, la cual contuvo mayor diversidad de artrópodos y presas de mejor calidad (i.e., Lepidoptera). V. luciae y D. petechia consumieron altas proporciones de presas encontradas en mayor abundancia en la zona de vegetación dominada por el tamarisco, que ha sido establecida desde la construcción de la Presa Glen Canyon. Estas especies parecieron exhibir plasticidad ecológica en respuesta a un incremento antropogénico en las presas como recuso alimenticio.

Macrophytes were grouped into three categories: Typha, graminoids and broadleaved plants. • Nitrogen was less limiting than P, consequently N availability varied less than P availability, NRP and NRE were lower, and N resorption was mostly incomplete. NRP was determined more by growth form than by local conditions. The large range of soil P concentrations allowed an exploration of relationships between P availability and resorption along a wide gradient. P-limited macrophytes (N : P > 16) had significantly higher PRP and PRE. Resorption proficiency was found to be a more sensitive indicator of changes in nutrient availability than resorption efficiency. • The results confirmed that resorption in wetland macrophytes depends on nutrient availability, and is higher at nutrient-limited sites. A particularly strong relationship was found between resorption indicators and P limitation expressed either as live tissue N : P or soil P.

MacArtney, Kate Bull	BMJ: British Medical Journal	302	6782	1991-04-20T00:00:00Z	pp. 935-939	BMJ Publishing Group	fla		Objective—To develop, test, and validate an algorithm for diagnosing disease in neonates during an over the telephone referral to a specialist cardiac centre. Design—A draft algorithm requiring only data available to a referring paediatrician was generated. This was modified in the light of a retrospective review of case records. A questionnaire to elicit all the data required by the algorithm was then generated. There followed a prospective three phase evaluation during consecutive over the telephone referrals. This consisted of (a) a conventional phase with unstructured referral consultations, (b) a phase with referrals structured around the questionnaire but independent of the algorithm, and (c) a validation phase with the algorithm (and its previous errors) available during the referral consultation. Setting—59 paediatric centres in south east England and a central specialist paediatric cardiology unit. Patients—Consecutive neonates (aged <31 days) referred with suspected heart disease. The retrospective review was of records of 174 neonates from 1979. In the prospective evaluation (1987-90) the conventional phase comprised 71 neonates (over 5.5 months), the structured phase 203 neonates (over 14 months), and the validation phase 195 neonates (over 12 months). Main outcome measures—Diagnostic accuracy (assigning patients to the correct diagnostic category (out of 27)), of the referring paediatrician, the specialist after the referral consultation, and the algorithm as compared with the definitive diagnosis by echocardiography at the specialist centre, and score for the appropriateness of management in transit. Results—Simply structuring the consultation by questionnaire (that is, proceeding from the conventional phase to the structured phase) improved the diagnostic accuracy of both paediatricians (from 34% (24/71 cases) to 48% (97/203) correct) and specialists (from 54% (38/71 cases) to 64% (130/203) correct). The algorithm (structured phase) would have been even more accurate (78% (158/203 cases); p<0.01). Management scores in the structured phase were also better than in the conventional phase (80% (162/203 cases) v 58% (41/71) appropriate; p<0.01). Management scores would have improved to 91% appropriate (185/203; p<0.001) had the algorithmic diagnoses dictated management. The superiority of the algorithm was maintained but not bettered in the validation phase. Conclusions—Applying the algorithm should reduce the morbidity and mortality of neonates with critical heart disease by aiding clinicians in therapeutic decisions for in transit care.

The sample was 143 undergraduate and 53 graduate women university students. A significant difference in GEFT was found when students were grouped according to the five areas of concentration or by the analytical-interpersonal nature of their chosen career positions. Significant correlations were found between GEFT and all ACT scores, undergraduate and graduate GPA, and graduate student career commitment. There was no significant relationship for GEFT with any GRE score, undergraduate career commitment, or ease of career choice. Little evidence of a differential effect of GEFT on achievement in analytical or social content courses was found.

Sharpe, Inc.	fla		We discuss the optimal way for a software vendor to license software: a perpetual license at a posted price, a subscription contract that subscribers receive automatic updates for periodic payment, or a hybrid approach that involves both. By addressing specific issues in the software market such as network effects, quality uncertainty, upgrade compatibility, and the vendor's ability to commit to future prices in a dynamic environment, we demonstrate how a software vendor can manage the trade-offs of perpetual licensing and subscription to optimize profit, as well as the corresponding welfare effect on consumers. Although the subscription model helps the vendor lock in consumers so as to increase profit when there is great uncertainty associated with the next version software, it destroys the path dependence in creating network externalities. Therefore, when the network effect is sufficiently large, it is more profitable for a software vendor to provide both perpetual licensing and subscription.

These results are particularly useful for accurately approximating the distribution of regression coefficients. General formulas are given for the distribution of the coefficients arising out of a generalized linear model with both canonical and noncanonical link functions. We illustrate the case of logistic regression with a real data example and show how the Gibbs sampler may be used to obtain confidence sets for each regression parameter based on the saddlepoint approximation.

Hughes	Journal of Animal Ecology	39	2	1970-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 333-356	British Ecological Society	fla		(1) Some factors affecting the general distribution of the bivalve Scrobicularia plana throughout the study area were height on the shore, low salinity from a neighbouring fresh-water stream, and the effect of the 1962-63 severe winter. However, the patchy distribution of Scrobicularia throughout the area could not be explained fully in terms of the above factors. (2) A series of sampling methods and statistical analyses failed to detect any significant departure from randomness in the spatial distribution of Scrobicularia within small areas where physical conditions were apparently uniform. The lack of a territorial effect between individuals of Scrobicularia received further support from laboratory experiments and field observations on feeding behaviour. (3) In November 1966 and November 1967, density and size-frequency distributions were studied in detail for two localities at different levels on the shore within the study area. Probability paper was used to analyse the polymodal distributions into arbitrary size groups which corresponded closely to actual age classes for animals up to four winters old, but larger animals could not be analysed into separate age groups and were lumped together under a single normal curve. The decrease in numbers in each size category between 1966 and 1967 was used to estimate their mortality during this period. Spat settled in 1966 incurred a mortality of about 50%, while mortality among the larger size groups ranged from 10 to 34%. Recruitment was much heavier in 1966 than in 1967, but in both years the highest recruitment occurred at the lower level of the study area where the density of adults was also greatest. (4) Annual growth was estimated by measuring the distances between successive, well-defined winter rings and using the Ford-Walford plot, by measuring the increase in shell-length of specially marked animals, and by following the shift in the size-frequency peaks corresponding to various age groups. All three methods gave similar results. Annual growth was expressed by the equation Lt+1 = 9.637 + 0.824 Lt where Lt = shell-length at one winter and Lt+1 = shell-length at next winter. (5) Predation by the oystercatcher between November 1966 and November 1967 rose and fell with the numbers of wintering birds in the area and was estimated to cause a mortality of about 5-6% of the Scrobicularia population which, in view of the errors involved, is very close to the estimated mortality of 10% in the same area. It was concluded that the oystercatcher is the main predator of Scrobicularia in this area. There appeared to be little selection of size-groups by the oystercatcher and many of even the largest Scrobicularia were within reach of its bill.

Yang	Public Choice	108	3/4	2001-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 295-312	Springer	fla		People turn out to cast their votes simply because they want to "cheer" or "boo" their favored or unfavored candidates. This expressive voting behavior is in marked contrast to the instrumental voting behavior, i.e., people vote because they perceive voting as a means of achieving a particular election outcome. In this paper we report an econometric study on voting behavior that uses data from the 1988 American National Election Study. The results reveal that the "cheering" and "booing" effects are statistically significant, and that they exert substantial influence on both turnout and voter choice. We also obtain evidence against the proposition that people turn out to vote because they consider themselves to be potentially decisive with regard to the election outcome.

Scheller	The Journal of Cell Biology	102	3	1986-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 769-782	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		Many neurons in the mollusc Aplysia are identifiable and provide a useful model system for investigating the cellular mechanisms used by the neuroendocrine system to mediate simple behaviors. In this study we determined the subcellular localization of eight Aplysia neuropeptides using immunogold labeling techniques, and analyzed the size distribution of dense core and granular vesicles in peptidergic neurons. Recent observations demonstrate that many neurons use multiple chemical messengers. Thus, an understanding of the functional significance of co-transmitters requires an analysis of their relative subcellular distributions. The peptides are expressed in a subset of neurons, or the exocrine atrial gland, and are primarily localized to dense core vesicles. Multiple regions of precursors which are cleaved into several components are co-localized. Each neuron has a distinct size distribution of peptide-containing dense core vesicles ranging in size from 65 to 600 nm. The atrial gland contains very large (up to 2 μm) peptide-containing granules. Single neurons have multiple populations of granules whose quantal sizes agree with predictions based on physical constraints. Some cells contain very large peptide-containing granules which are found in the cell soma and not in processes. Thus, the genetic determination of neuronal cell type includes not only transmitter choices but also multiple modes of packaging the intercellular messengers.

We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies on semi-concealed and exposed caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in lowland and montane tropical rain forests, using plasticine models of caterpillars. We recorded attacks on caterpillars in four habitats: primary forest, secondary forest and forest fragment in lowlands (200 m asl), and montane primary forest (1700 m asl). We used 300 exposed and 300 semi-concealed caterpillars daily, and conducted the experiment for 6 d in every habitat. Daily incidence of attacks was higher on exposed caterpillars (4.95%) than on semi-concealed (leaf-rolling) caterpillars (2.99%). Attack pressure of natural enemies differed also among habitats. In the lowlands, continuous primary and secondary forests had similar daily incidence of attacks (2.39% and 2.36%) which was however lower than that found in a primary forest fragment (4.62%). This difference was caused by higher incidence of attacks by birds, ants and wasps in the forest fragment. The most important predators were birds in montane rain forests (61.9% of identified attacks), but insect predators, mostly ants, in the lowlands (58.3% of identified attacks). These results suggest that rapid decrease in the abundance of ants with altitude may be compensated by increased importance of birds as predators in montane forests. Further, it suggests that small rain-forest fragments may suffer from disproportionately high pressure from natural enemies, with potentially serious consequences for survival of their herbivorous communities.

Gillis	The Journal of Wildlife Management	62	4	1998-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1300-1306	Wildlife Society, Wiley	fla		Knowledge of mortality factors is important for developing strategies to conserve the swift fox (Vulpes velox), a species being considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act, but available information about swift fox mortality is inadequate. We used radiotelemetry techniques to examine the magnitude and causes of mortality of swift fox populations in 2 study areas in western Kansas. One study area was predominantly cropland, the other rangeland. Mortality rates, calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimation techniques in a staggered entry design, were 0.55 ± 0.08 (x̄ ± SE) for adult and 0.67 ± 0.08 for juvenile swift foxes. We did not detect differences between study areas in mortality rates for adults or juveniles. Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) was the major cause of mortality for adult and juvenile swift foxes in both study areas, and vehicle collision was an important mortality factor for juveniles in the cropland study area. No mortality was attributed to starvation or disease.

(2) Leaf and fruit infestation reduced fruit production and total net production (in energy units) of plants allowed to grow for 9 weeks after infestation. Net production and fruit production of plants allowed to grow for 13 weeks were not significantly different from that of control plants. (3) No organ on infested plants (except fruits) differed in specific energy or nitrogen concentration from its counterpart on control plants; infested fruits had lower specific energy than non-infested fruits. (4) Estimated consumption rates for fruit-infesting larvae indicated that the cost to the plant of producing an infested fruit (in terms of energy and of nitrogen) was approximately equal to the cost of producing a seeded fruit.

Specifically, it uses regression discontinuity design to estimate the turnout and election impacts of Spanish-language assistance provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Analyses of two different data sets—the Latino National Survey and California 1998 primary election returns—show that Spanish-language assistance increased turnout for citizens who speak little English. The California results also demonstrate that election procedures can influence outcomes, as support for ending bilingual education dropped markedly in heavily Spanish-speaking neighborhoods with Spanish-language assistance. Small changes in election procedures can influence who votes as well as what wins.

Gaps were created in a relictual Pinus radiata plantation destined for restoration to native forest. Seeds of the native species Alectryon excelsus, Macropiper excelsum, and Fuchsia excorticata, and the invasive alien species Cytisus scoparius and Berberis darwinii were sown in sites differing in exposure, with and without 3 cm of pine litter. Litter promoted germination of Alectryon and Macropiper, independent of site. Without litter, percent germination of Macropiper was negatively correlated with percent open sky overhead. Germination of Fuchsia was significantly higher in treefall gaps than in the forest understory, with litter having little effect. Cytisus germinated most successfully in sites exposed to direct solar radiation, with or without litter. Percent germination of Berberis was high in all sites, and was consistently promoted by litter. Glasshouse trials for each species showed the same effects of litter cover as found in the field. These results suggest that microenvironmental heterogeneity can be an important influence on the species composition of regenerating vegetation within and around treefall gaps.

An abundant literature supports such a claim even when controls are introduced for such things as the income of the single parent, the educational attainment of the single parent, the years spent in a single-parent family, the age at which the disruption of the child's family occurred (in the case of divorce or separation), the type of single-parent family (divorced/never-married parent), the child's race, and a host of other, seemingly important background factors. Still, the attainment deficits persist. In this article an explanation for part of this deficit is advanced. It is proposed that one reason why children of one-parent families achieve less as adults is that they lack exposure to hierarchical models of authority relations in their families. The family serves as the prototype of all authority relationships. By virtue of living in nonhierarchical families, children from single-parent households are handicapped in their ability to function in institutions that are fundamentally hierarchical, namely, education, the economy, and occupations.

In contrast, the more ubiquitously expressed isoform GLUT1 is localized at the cell surface in the basal state, and shows a less dramatic translocation in response to insulin. To identify sequences involved in the differential subcellular localization and hormone-responsiveness of these isoforms, chimeric GLUT1/GLUT4 transporters were stably expressed in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The  NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of GLUT4 contains sequences capable of sequestering the transporter inside the cell, although not in an insulin-sensitive pool. In contrast, the COOH-terminal 30 amino acids of GLUT4 are sufficient for its correct localization to an intracellular storage pool which translocates to the cell surface in response to insulin. The dileucine motif within this domain, which is required for intracellular sequestration of chimeric transporters in fibroblasts, is not critical for targeting to the hormone-responsive compartment in adipocytes. Analysis of rates of internalization of chimeric transporter after the removal of insulin from cells, as well as the subcellular distribution of transporters in cells unexposed to or treated with insulin, leads to a three-pool model which can account for the data.

Len Doyal	Journal of Medical Ethics	33	10	2007-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 573-576	BMJ Publishing Group	fla		Benatar argues that it is better never to have been born because of the harms always associated with human existence. Non-existence entails no harm, along with no experience of the absence of any benefits that existence might offer. Therefore, he maintains that procreation is morally irresponsible, along with the use of reproductive technology to have children. Women should seek termination if they become pregnant and it would be better for potential future generations if humans become extinct as soon as humanely possible. These views are challenged by the argument that while decisions not to procreate may be rational on the grounds of the harm that might occur, it may equally rational to gamble under certain circumstances that future children would be better-off experiencing the harms and benefits of life rather than never having the opportunity of experiencing anything. To the degree that Benatar's arguments preclude the potential rationality of any such gamble, their moral relevance to concrete issues concerning human reproduction is weakened. However, he is right to emphasise the importance of foreseen harm when decisions are made to attempt to have children.

Our theoretical framework links national characteristics to individual characteristics and perceptions. We hypothesize that the influence of work-family status on perceptions of women's opportunities varies by gender and country because of cross-national differences in ideology and policy. Separate multiple regression analyses for women and men in each country indicate important variations in the effects of labor force participation, family income, age, and family status on perceptions of women's opportunities for education and employment.

Very low rates of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are achievable with use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We examine risk factors for MTCT in the HAART era and describe infants who were vertically infected, despite exposure to prophylactic MTCT interventions. Methods. Of the 4525 mother-child pairs in this prospective cohort study, 1983 were enrolled during the period of January 1997 through May 2004. Factors examined included use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, maternal CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level, mode of delivery, and gestational age in logistic regression analysis. Results. Receipt of antenatal antiretroviral therapy increased from 5% at the start of the HAART era to 92% in 2001-2003. The overall MTCT rate in this period was 2.87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.11%-3.81%), but it was 0.99% (95% CI, 0.32%-2.30%) during 2001-2003. In logistic regression analysis that included 885 mother-child pairs, MTCT risk was associated with high maternal viral load (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 12.1; P = .003) and elective Caesarean section (AOR, 0.33; P = .04). Detection of maternal HIV RNA was significantly associated with antenatal use of antiretroviral therapy, CD4 cell count, and mode of delivery. Among 560 women with undetectable HIV RNA levels, elective Caesarean section was associated with a 90% reduction in MTCT risk (odds ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.33), compared with vaginal delivery or emergency Caesarean section. Conclusions. Our results suggest that offering an elective Caesarean section delivery to all HIV-infected women, even in areas where HAART is available, is appropriate clinical management, especially for persons with detectable viral loads. Our results also suggest that previously identified risk factors remain important.

Deepak Nayyar	Economic and Political Weekly	41	15	2006-04-15T00:00:00Z	pp. 1451-1458	Economic and Political Weekly	fla		The story of economic development in independent India is often distorted by beliefs in fashion or caricatures of perceptions which shape conventional wisdom. This is misleading, not only in analysing the past but also in contemplating the future. If we consider India during the 20th century as a whole, the turning point in economic growth was circa 1951. If we consider India since independence, the turning point in economic growth was circa 1980. And it is clear that the turning point in the early 1950s was much more significant than the structural break in the early 1980s. In the first phase of growth in post-independent India, from 1950 to 1980, India was not the lumbering elephant that it is often made out to be. In the second phase, from 1980 to 2005, India was not quite the running tiger that some believe it has become. The real failure, throughout the second half of the 20th century, was India's inability to transform its growth into development, which would have brought about an improvement in the living conditions of ordinary people.

Hensley	Ecology	74	8	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 2405-2412	Ecological Society of America	fla		Amphibian larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity in size at metamorphosis and duration of the larval period. I used Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles to test two models for predicting tadpole age and size at metamorphosis under changing environmental conditions. The Wilbur-Collins model states that metamorphosis is initiated as a function of a tadpole's size and relative growth rate, and predicts that changes in growth rate throughout the larval period affect age and size at metamorphosis. An alternative model, the fixed-rate model, states that age at metamorphosis is fixed early in larval life, and subsequent changes in growth rate will have no effect on the length of the larval period. My results confirm that food supplies affect both age and size at metamorphosis, but developmental rates became fixed at approximately Gosner (1960) stages 35-37. Neither model completely predicted these results. I suggest that the generally accepted Wilbur-Collins model is improved by incorporating a point of fixed developmental timing. Growth trajectories predicted from this modified model fit the results of this study better than trajectories based on either of the original models. The results of this study suggest a constraint that limits the simultaneous optimization of age and size at metamorphosis.

Above all, we wanted to examine the influence of smoking status on the relationship between chronic disease and psychological distress/depressed mood. Methods: A postal survey was conducted among 12,103 employees participating in the Maastricht Cohort Study. Results: Smoking employees, who reported having asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema were more likely to report suffering from depressed mood compared to smokers with no long-lasting disease (prevalence rate, PR: 29.3 and 9.0%, respectively; OR for depressed mood = 4.04; 95% CI: 2.56-6.39) and when compared to smoking employees with a history of heart disease, hypertension or myocardial infarction (PR: 18.1%; OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.07-3.68), or rheumatoid arthritis (PR: 20.1%; OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 0.96-3.11). Conclusion: These findings provide health care professionals with additional evidence regarding the importance for including the assessment of psychological distress and depressed mood in the routine evaluation of the patient with asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, especially with regard to smoking cessation.

Oneal	The Journal of Conflict Resolution	35	2	1991-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 307-332	Sage Publications, Inc.	fla		Ostrom and Job (1986) found that domestic, political factors are more influential on the president's decision to use military force than characteristics of the international environment. These results pose a serious challenge to realists' assumptions regarding the motives of states and the separability of domestic and foreign policy. This article reexamines Ostrom and Job's arguments and introduces a new indicator, a measure of the severity of ongoing international crises, to provide a better assessment of the relative effect of the international environment on presidential decision making. This severity index is significantly associated with the use of force by the United States from 1949 through 1976, and proves to be more influential than the international indicators used by Ostrom and Job. Nevertheless, domestic political factors remain most consequential in the president's decision to use force short of war.

Lord	American Journal of Botany	70	10	1983-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1499-1508	Botanical Society of America	fla		An individual of Collomia grandiflora typically produces both closed or cleistogamous (CL) and open or chasmogamous (CH) flowers. The developmental origin of these dimorphic floral types within a plant was investigated using histological techniques, allometric relationships, and scanning electron microscopy. Prior to archesporal cell stage in the anthers, CL and CH meristems are indistinguishable. In the CL anther, an absence of ventral locule cell differentiation together with a shorter period of time between archesporial cell differentiation and meiosis in the two dorsal locules results in accelerated anther dehiscence and a smaller mature anther size and pollen grain number. Divergence between the CL and CH patterns of corolla development is coincident with microspore mitosis in the CH anther. At this point, there is an increase in growth in corolla length relative to growth in calyx length in the CH flower which does not occur in the CL flower. Calyx and ovary development are similar in the two floral forms; however, ovary expansion due to fertilization occurs earlier in the CL flower as a result of precocious anther development and stigma receptivity. The hypothesis that anther differentiation may trigger organ growth rate changes and differentiation events in the flower and hypothetical roles for abscisic acid and gibberellin in modifying floral development in C. grandiflora are discussed.

The tax competition literature has concentrated on mobility of tax base and tax levels, while we turn the attention to the political decision-making system and the determination of tax structure. In the Norwegian setting local governments make a discrete choice whether to have property tax. The local choice is investigated in an econometric model allowing for yardstick competition. Our results indicate that yardstick competition explains the distinct geographic pattern in local property taxation observed. Grants have no effect on the propensity to have property taxation, consistent with the flypaper effect. The main methodological challenge handled concerns spatial interaction with discrete choice.

Drinking-Driving typology, are examined empirically. Each typology is measured by three methods. One measurement method, characterized as "quantitative," consists of statistical modeling of responses to Likert-type items collected in structured interviews. The two other measurement methods, characterized as "qualitative," are judgmental codings of data collected from a schedule of open-ended and projective tasks conducted in face-to-face, in-home interviews. Two well-known methods, Campbell and Fiske's multimethod-multitrait approach and the analysis of covariance structures (LISREL) approach, are used to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the lifestyle typologies. In addition, Browne's class of direct product factor models is introduced and applied. In contrast to the well-known LISREL approach, direct product models assume the effects of method factors on trait factors are multiplicative instead of additive.

Within local bird communities, relationships between body size and abundance across the subtaxa within lower-level taxa (such as species within genera) are no more likely to be positive than those across the subtaxa in higher-level taxa (such as suborders within orders). 2. The species within tribes of birds which have no close relatives in the world tend to show positive relationships between body size and population abundance. However, the relatedness of the tribe to others in its community is not a significant predictor of the sign of the body size-abundance pattern. 3. The date at which the species last shared a common ancestor is a better predictor of the size-abundance pattern than is the relatedness of a tribe to other birds in the world. 4. The patterns do not appear to hold for Passeriforme birds, possibly because there is little variation in the dates of origin and radiation among passerine tribes. 5. It has been suggested that tribes containing fewer different lifestyles (and which therefore are likely to be direct competitors with each other) will be those that tend to show positive size-abundance relationships. Hence, the length of the entry for a tribe in Austin's (1961) handbook of birds of the world is a statistically significant predictor of the sign of the relationship between body size and abundance, independently of the number of species in the tribe.

The resulting phylogenetic trees were compared with the results of previous molecular and morphological studies. Results demonstrate that the subgenus Aporodon is monophyletic. Relationships determined on the basis of allozymes are largely congruent with an earlier analysis based on morphological and molecular characters. However, samples of R. mexicanus do not form a monophyletic lineage. Accordingly, populations from north-central Oaxaca and Costa Rica each likely represent an undescribed species.

The data base is taken from the National Crime Survey (NCS) national sample for the years 1973 to 1978. The theoretical predictions tested are that (1) the relative size of the same group in different neighborhood contexts is inversely related to extent of outgroup victimization; and (2) neighborhood heterogeneity is positively related to rates of intergroup victimization. These predictions are tested with data on the interpersonal crimes of rape, robbery, assault, and larceny for two major parameters in Blau's theory-race and age. The results support the hypotheses and show that while ingroup victimization is highly prevalent in the United States, interracial and interage criminal encounters are strongly and positively related to neighborhood heterogeneity.

Dispersal contributes to spatio-temporal variation in population size and is a key process in studies of life history evolution and studies with conservation implications. However, dispersal is still one of the major gaps in our knowledge of ecological dynamics. The very large literature on metapopulation dynamics lacks empirical bases on dispersal and relevant behavioural parameters. We used multistate capture-recapture models (data from 1988 to 2001) to address hypotheses about movement probability and habitat selection within a system of two breeding colonies in Audouin's gulls (Larus audouinii), an endemic species breeding in the Mediterranean and considered as threatened. 2. Movement probability varied over time, and differed greatly between the colonies. 3. We did not find evidence of an influence of colony size or density of predators on movement probability. 4. In dispersers, our results did not support the hypotheses that movement probability between year t and t + 1 was influenced by mean breeding success in the colony of origin (i.e. an indicator of habitat quality) or the destination colony in year t or t + 1, or by the ratio of breeding success in these colonies in year t or t + 1 (i.e. quality gradient). 5. Overall, movement probability was higher from the smaller colony to the larger, and from the colony with lower breeding success in year t to the more productive one. This provides slight support for two nonexclusive hypotheses about habitat selection (conspecific attraction and conspecific success attraction). 6. Movement probability from the smaller, less productive colony was very high in some years, suggesting that the dynamics of both colonies were strongly influenced by adult dispersal. However, in absolute numbers, more individuals moved from the larger, more productive colony to the smaller one. This suggests that the system may function as a source-sink system. 7. Use of multistate models to re-assess local survival showed that survival was lower in the less productive colony with higher emigration probability. This may reflect genuine differences in mortality between colonies, or more probably differences in permanent emigration from the study area.

These questions are examined by analysing bodies situated at the intersection of science and law. More specifically, the transformation of 'private bodies ' into 'public bodies' is analysed by going into the details of forensic DNA profiling in the Dutch jurisdiction. It will be argued that various forensic genetic practices ' enact different forensic genetic bodies'. These enacted forensic genetic bodies are connected with various infringements of civil rights, which become articulated in exploring these forensic genetic bodies ' 'normative registers'.

To that end, we select for review those works that reflect a wide range of theory and practice          in public history, as well as selected works from other disciplines that are of particular note to public historians. Reviewers evaluate research in terms of its contribution to historical inquiry as well          as for its value as a work of public history. Reviewers are also encouraged to identify emerging trends, problems, and opportunities for public history and its related subfields. The studies under review          are most often books, but the journal also seeks to identify and review writings in every form that public historians produce. The editors welcome your comments and suggestions on all aspects of the review          enterprise.

We compared benthic cover, sea urchin and fish abundance in unfished marine parks and fished reefs and the reef-associated fisheries 3 years before and after 1998. Hard and soft coral decreased while coralline algae increased in both management areas. Turf increased in marine parks and sponge and fleshy algae increased in the fished reefs. Sea urchin grazer biomass was unchanged over this period and the fish community changed less than benthic cover. In general, butterflyfish, damselfish and wrasses were negatively influenced while surgeonfish and a few uncommon families were positively influenced by the substratum change. There was a 17% increase in fishing effort as measured by fishermen per day at each landing site and the total demersal catch declined by 8% and the catch per man declined by 21% after 1998. The decline in the total catch and CPUE combined with the increase in effort suggest an overexploited fishery and this makes it difficult to distinguish changes caused by coral mortality or fishing effort. The price of fish increased over this period and this caused an 18% increase in the total value of the fishery but no difference in the net income of individual fishermen.

Newell	American Journal of Botany	76	10	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1518-1523	Botanical Society of America	fla		Caribbean cycads (Zamia L.) are well known for variation in leaflet morphology. Here, I examine the variation in leaflet morphology among five populations of Zamia in Florida. Variables measured were leaflet length and width, leaflet length: width ratio, leaflet surface area, rachis and petiole lengths, number of leaflets per leaf, and total leaf area. In addition to comparisons among the Florida populations, these populations are compared with three previously studied populations in Puerto Rico (Newell, 1986). For the most part, the populations exhibited significant differences in all variables. In spite of the extensive morphological variation in this group of plants, leaflet morphology has long been important in Zamia taxonomy. The Florida populations would be considered by some to be either one, two, or three different species. The Florida and Puerto Rico populations together might be considered as few as one species or as many as five species. Based upon the data presented here, the five Florida populations appear to represent a single species; and the three Puerto Rico populations appear to represent two additional species. Further clarification of the taxonomy of Caribbean Zamia will require additional characters such as cone morphology and protein or DNA patterns.

Singpurwalla	Journal of the American Statistical Association	90	429	1995-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 220-226	American Statistical Association	fla		We present a Bayesian approach for inference and predictions from nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes. The novel feature of our approach is the use of "expert knowledge" or "engineering information" on the mean value function of the process. We describe two scenarios from the field of reliability in which engineering information on the mean value function is available. The first scenario pertains to the prediction of software failures during the debugging phase. Here expert knowledge is provided by the published empirical experiences of software engineers involved with the testing and debugging of several software systems. The second scenario pertains to the prediction of defects in a rail segment for which expert knowledge is supplied by an engineering model.

Efavirenz exhibits marked interindividual variability in plasma levels and toxicities. Prior pharmacogenetic studies usually measure exposure via single plasma levels, examine limited numbers of polymorphisms, and rarely model multiple contributors. We analyzed numerous genetic and nongenetic factors impacting short-term and long-term exposure in a large heterogeneous population of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women. Methods. We performed 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic studies in 111 women receiving efavirenz under actual-use conditions and calculated the area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) to assess short-term exposure; the efavirenz concentration in hair was measured to estimate long-term exposure. A total of 182 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 45 haplotypes in 9 genes were analyzed in relationship to exposure by use of multivariate models that included a number of nongenetic factors. Results. Efavirenz AUCs increased 1.26-fold per doubling of the alanine aminotransferase level and 1.23-fold with orange and/or orange juice consumption. Individuals with the CYP2B6 516TT genotype displayed 3.5-fold increases in AUCs and 3.2-fold increases in hair concentrations, compared with individuals with the TG/GG genotype. Another SNP in CYP2B6 (983TT) and a p-glycoprotein haplotype affected AUCs without substantially altering longterm exposure. Conclusions. This comprehensive pharmacogenomics study showed that individuals with the CYP2B6 516TT genotype displayed >3-fold increases in both short-term and long-term efavirenz exposure, signifying durable effects. Pharmacogenetic testing combined with monitoring of hair levels may improve efavirenz outcomes and reduce toxicities.

The penetration of hydrocarbons into the soil column depended on soil moisture and drainage characteristics. Biodegradation, shown by changes in the pristane to heptadecane and resolvable to total gas Chromatographie area ratios, appeared to be greatly restricted in drier tundra soils during one year exposure. Some light hydrocarbons, C₉— C₁₀, were recovered from soils one year after spillages. Hydrocarbons were still present in soils at Fish Creek, Alaska, contaminated by refined oil spillages 28 years earlier, attesting to the persistence of hydrocarbons in North Slope soils. /// Du "brut de Prudhoe Bay" et du fuel de diesel, raffiné, étaient répandus sur 5 sols de toundras, topographiquement distincts, à Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. La profondeur de pénétration en hydrocarbures dans le sol dépendait de l'humidité du sol et des caractéristiques de drainage. Les rendements de Chromatographie gazeuse d'un gaz entièrement analysé montraient des changements dans l'importance des pristanes et heptadecanes, ceci indiquait une biodégradation, apparaissant plus restreinte dans les sols plus secs de toundra, au cours d'une expérience d'un an. Quelques hydrocarbures légers C₉— C₁₀, étaient récupérés du sol, un an après la pollution. A Fish Creek, Alaska, des hydrocarbures étaient encore présents dans le sol contaminé par des fuites de pétrole raffiné, 28 ans plus tôt; ceci atteste la persistance des hydrocarbures dans les sols du "North Slope".

Giblin, K. J. Nadelhoffer	Arctic and Alpine Research	28	3	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 363-379	INSTAAR, University of Colorado	fla		In the arctic landscape, vegetation composition and structure are strongly affected by topographic position and associated variation in microclimate. Along a single riverside toposequence in northern Alaska, six distinct plant communities were studied including a riparian shrub community, a wet sedge tundra, a footslope Equisetum community, a hillslope shrub/lupine community, a hilltop birch-heath community, and a moist tussock tundra. Total live plant biomass varied threefold along the toposequence (450-1400 g m-2) while live vascular plant biomass (including belowground stems and rhizomes but not roots) varied sevenfold (160-970 g m-2). Aboveground vascular plant production varied less than fourfold (80-265 g m-2). Although all six communities showed some signs of nutrient limitation, measures of soil nutrient availability were highly variable among communities. Contrary to expectations, the most productive community along the toposequence was the hillslope shrub/lupine community, where a late-lying snowbank delayed the start of the growing season by 2 wk. The second most productive community was the hilltop birch-heath, which was exposed to winter winds and where snow melted earliest; most of the production in this community occurred in relatively protected depressions where there were dense accumulations of plant mass. A conclusion is that soil fertility, soil thaw, and protection from wind are more important than length of the snow-free season in regulating productivity along the toposequence. Also contrary to expectations, overall production:live biomass ratios of the six communities varied little despite large differences in growth form composition among communities and in biomass turnover among growth forms. High-biomass, highly productive communities had the lowest production:live biomass ratios, and thus the lowest biomass turnover. Because production and live biomass were linearly correlated over the entire range sampled, it may be possible to use live biomass and/or leaf area as a reasonably accurate predictor of productivity at the landscape or regional level in the Arctic.

Brown	Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences	367	1899	2009-07-28T00:00:00Z	pp. 2947-2956	The Royal Society	fla		Numerical simulations of the atmosphere are routinely carried out on various scales for purposes ranging from weather forecasts for local areas a few hours ahead to forecasts of climate change over periods of hundreds of years. Almost without exception, these forecasts are made with space/time-averaged versions of the governing Navier-Stokes equations and laws of thermodynamics, together with additional terms representing internal and boundary forcing. The calculations are a form of large eddy modelling, because the subgrid-scale processes have to be modelled. In the global atmospheric models used for long-term predictions, the primary method is implicit large eddy modelling, using discretization to perform the averaging, supplemented by specialized subgrid models, where there is organized small-scale activity, such as in the lower boundary layer and near active convection. Smaller scale models used for local or shortrange forecasts can use a much smaller averaging scale. This allows some of the specialized subgrid models to be dropped in favour of direct simulations. In research mode, the same models can be run as a conventional large eddy simulation only a few orders of magnitude away from a direct simulation. These simulations can then be used in the development of the subgrid models for coarser resolution models.

Two 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed using total genomic DNA and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for archaeal or bacterial domains. Phylogenetic analysis of 132 and 249 almost fulllength 16S rRNA genes for Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, was done using the ARB software package. Phylogenetic groups affiliated with the Archaea belong to Euryarchaeota (93.8% of the operational taxonomie units [OTUs]) and Crenarchaeota (6.2% of the OTUs). Within the bacterial library, 84.8% of the OTUs represent novel putative phylotypes never described before and affiliated with ten divisions. The Proteobacteria phylum is the most abundant and diversified phylogenetic group representing 60.4% of the OTUs, followed by Bacteroidetes (22.1%) and gram-positives (6.1%). Interestingly, we detected a novel Proteobacteria monophyletic group distinct from the five known subclasses, which we named New Lineage of Proteobacteria (NLP) lineage, and it is composed of eight clones representing 4.6% of the Proteobacteria. A new 16S rRNA-targeted hybridization probe was designed and fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses shows representatives of NLP as cocci-shaped microorganisms. The Chloroflexi, Acidobacterium, and Nitrospira phyla and TM7 candidate division are each represented by ≤3% of clone sequences. A comprehensive set of eight 16S and 23 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was used to quantify these major groups by dot blot hybridization within 12 samples. The Proteobacteria accounted for 82.5±4.9%, representing the most abundant phyla. The Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetales groups accounted for 4.9±1.3% and 4±1.7%, respectively. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria together accounted for only 1.9±0.5%. The set of probes covers 93.4 ± 14% of the total bacterial population rRNA within the anoxic basin.

Kelly	New Phytologist	131	3	1995-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 311-327	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		A survey of 100 species and 122 observations has shown an average reduction in stomatal density of 14.3% (SE ± 2.2%) with CO2 enrichment, with 74% of the cases exhibiting a reduction in stomatal density. A sign test demonstrated that stomatal density decreases, in response to CO2, significantly more often than expected by chance. Repeated observations on the same species indicated a significant repeatability in the direction of the stomatal response. Analyses which removed the potential effect of taxonomy on this data set showed no significant patterns in the dependency of the degree of stomatal change on growth form (woodiness vs. non-woodiness; trees vs. shrubs), habitat (cool vs. warm) or stomatal distribution on the leaf (amphi- vs. hypostomatous). Forty-three of the observations had been made in controlled environments and under a typical range in CO2 enrichment of 350-700 μmol mol-1. For these cases the average stomatal density declined by 9% (SE ± 3.3%) and 60% of the cases showed reductions in stomatal density. When analyses were restricted to these 43 observations, amphistomatous samples more frequently had greater changes in stomatal density than did hypostomatous samples. The degree of reduction in stomatal density with increasing CO2 increases with initial stomatal density, after the influence of taxonomy is removed using analyses of independent contrasts. When the data were examined for patterns that might be due explicitly to the effects of relatedness, the subclasses of the Hamamelidae and the Rosidae showed highly significant reductions in stomatal density with CO2 (87% of the species studied in the Hamamelidae and 80% of the species in the Rosidae showed reduction with CO2 enrichment) and correlations between initial stomatal density and degree of reduction in stomatal density. The species sampled in the Hamamelidae were dominantly trees, whereas herbs dominated the species in the Rosidae. There were insufficient species studied at lower taxonomic levels to warrant further statistical analyses. This problem results from experimental and observational data being most often restricted to one species per taxonomic level, typically up to the level of order, a feature which can severely limit the extraction of taxonomically-related and ecologically-related plant responses.

Unfortunately, little has been written to aid firms in identifying countries that offer this type of fit. This paper presents a model that combines the concepts of strategic management, cross-cultural management, business ethics, and the management science technique of goal programming. The purpose of the model is to aid managers in identifying countries for international expansion that offer the best fit with the firm's ethical orientation. The paper also extends the existing literature on cross-cultural management and business ethics by applying a computer optimization model to evaluate potential countries for international expansion in a way that has not been done before.

Lawless	Biometrics	49	1	1993-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 107-121	International Biometric Society	fla		Toxicologists frequently conduct toxicity experiments in which different treatment conditions are applied to groups of animals and the resulting mortality in each group is measured at a number of discrete time points over the course of the experiment. Both survival analysis and generalized linear models have been proposed for analyzing this type of data. Whatever the approach taken, the model should allow for the presence of extra-multinomial variation arising from the use of groups of animals rather than individuals as the experimental units. We consider a number of models for overdispersion that can be incorporated into the generalized linear model framework for multinomial data. These models are extensions of ones proposed for binomial data by Williams (1982, Applied Statistics 31, 144-148) and Moore (1986, Biometrika 73, 583-588; 1987, Applied Statistics 36, 8-14). In addition, we examine robust asymptotic covariance matrix estimators for regression parameters, similar to those given in Liang and Zeger (1986, Biometrika 73, 13-22) and Zeger and Liang (1986, Biometrics 42, 121-130), and compare them to the model-based asymptotic estimators. Recommendations for analysis are given.

Under conditions generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if "independent" variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on "micro" and "macro" data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias. Finally, the estimation procedure and the "micro-test" for aggregation bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935-1954, for two firms.

In this process, elements considered impartial or invisible become consciously manipulated tools, deconstructed and reassigned as narrative devices. The author posits that this reassessment is essential for the continued development of any medium or genre and discusses reasons for its recent renewed prominence. The author traces convention-crossing in several media, revealing attributes that are redefined by subversions, and explores subversions of digital media constructs, before discussing his own forays into web-based works that hinge on the artifice of convention.

Brewer	PS: Political Science and Politics	43	4	2010-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 767-771	American Political Science Association	fla		This article uses a case study to illustrate how science fair projects—which traditionally focus on "hard science" topics—can contribute to political science education. One of the authors, a high school student, conducted an experimental study of politics for her science fair project. The other author, a faculty member, was asked to advise the student on the project to allay initial skepticism about its focus on a "soft science" topic. The results of the experiment indicated that exposure to a televised comedy sketch about the 2008 presidential campaign yielded learning effects and fostered political interest among high school students. The authors recommend political science fair projects as tools for introducing precollegiate students to the political science research process and offering political scientists opportunities to educate students beyond the university setting.

For the 400 donations with neopterin concentrations above the 98th percentile and another 1200 donations with neopterin concentrations in the lower range, results of human parvovirus (HPV) B19 tests were compared. Infectious specimens were identified by dot blot hybridization assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that used the outer primers and detected 1 pg of HPV B19 DNA, corresponding to  $~10^5$  copies of the genome, in the specimens and by a nested PCR that detected 1-10 fg of DNA, corresponding to  $10^{2}-10^{3}$  copies of the genome. Of 400 specimens with neopterin concentrations ≥12 nmol/L (98th percentile, current cutoff), 10 tested positive by dot blot hybridization assay (9 of these were confirmed by nested PCR). Among 1200 specimens with low neopterin concentrations (<12 nmol/L), no specimen containing HPV B19 DNA was detected. These findings suggest an association between elevated neopterin concentrations and HPV B19 infectivity.

The 3 groups consisted of kibbutz children who were raised communally, with peers; kibbutz children raised in families; and city children in traditional families. The results showed that communally raised children were significantly lower on positive affective expression compared with the other 2 groups, thus supporting the "moderation" hypothesis. The communally raised children expressed the most negativity of the 3 groups toward nonfamily figures but the least negativity toward familial figures. Kibbutz children raised in families were similar to children from traditional families on some measurements and occupied an intermediate position, between kibbutz-communal and traditional, on other measurements.

Jacobsen	Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society	71	4	1998-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 426-438	Allen Press, Kansas (Central States) Entomological Society	fla		Aspects of the symbiotic relationship of a species of Nanocladius (Plecopteracoluthus) associated with mayfly nymphs in a mountain stream in Arizona are described including its prevalence on three host species, infestation pattern, attachment site selection and feeding behavior. Larvae of this species, designated here as N. (P.) sp. 2, were found primarily on nymphs of Thraulodes sp. (Leptophlebiidae) and occasionally on Choroterpes sp. (Leptophlebiidae) and Leucrocuta sp. (Heptageniidae). Sixty-seven of 116 (58%) Thraulodes sp. nymphs from one collection site harbored from 1-5 N. (P.) sp. 2 larvae (abundance: 0.99 larvae/nymph; mean intensity: 1.72 larvae/host nymph). The range of larval attachment sites on the host became narrower as larvae matured. Most 3rd and 4th instar larvae constructed tubes on Thraulodes sp. that extended from the thorax between the middle and hind coxae posteriorly to the 7th abdominal segment along the lateral margin of the tergites. Pupation occurred within this tube with the pupa oriented posteriorly. The gut contents of larvae and presence of scars at sites of larval attachment on hosts indicate N. (P.) sp. 2 fed upon host hemolymph. Larval feeding and tube construction resulted in gill reduction, or deformation as well as scarring of gill and other body surfaces. However, parasitized Thraulodes sp. nymphs were capable of metamorphosis to adulthood. Dispersion patterns of larvae and pupae across the host population imply intraspecific competition or parasite-induced mortality may limit the parasite's population size. The life stage structure of N. (P.) sp. 2 from this stream suggested the population was not synchronized, but was likely comprised of at least two overlapping generations at the time of collection. Early instars were most abundant on large, late-instar nymphs and on nymphs harboring later midge instars. Late instar larvae of the older cohort tended to be more prevalent on less mature nymphs, suggesting the parasite and/or the host may affect the others' development. Because collections were limited to only one date, the hypotheses presented should be regarded as speculative and tentative until a more extensive study can be performed.

The proposed method is to replace the missing quantities in the estimating function with consistent estimates. In special cases, the proposed model reduces to a weighted GEE model for the completely observed units, where the weight is the inverse of the probability of missingness. Our method can be viewed as an extension of the mean score method by Reilly and Pepe (1995, Biometrika 82, 299-314) to the GEE context. Under certain regularity conditions, the estimates of the regression coefficients obtained by the proposed method are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The finite sample properties of the estimates are illustrated via computer simulations. An application to the study of dementia among stroke patients is presented.

Fleming	Journal of Mammalogy	72	3	1991-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 493-501	American Society of Mammalogists	fla		I tested the hypothesis that body size significantly influences diet and habitat use in frugivorous bats of the genus Carollia (Phyllostomidae) by studying pairs or triplets of species in two Costa Rican habitats and by supplementing these data with published data from one Panamanian locality. I predicted that with an increase in body size, average size of fruit consumed increases, nutritional quality of fruit consumed decreases, and proportion of time spent feeding in second growth decreases. At each site, the smallest species of Carollia was the most common species in second-growth habitats, and its diet contained a higher proportion of nutritionally rich Piper fruits and a lower proportion of large fruits than that of larger species. A multivariate ecomorphological analysis indicated that sympatric Carollia species are similarly arrayed in niche space in wet and dry tropical forests and that sister species are farther apart in niche space than are nonsister species.

In addition, from approximately 13 weeks of age to slaughter, 0.5 kg hay was offered daily. The crossbred animals were slaughtered 1 week after reaching 450 kg liveweight and the Friesians 1 week after reaching 400 kg liveweight. Calculated to 400 kg liveweight, average daily gains were 0.94, 0.98 and 0.99 kg and feed conversion efficiencies were 5.25, 4.67 and 5.12 kg concentrate/kg gain for crossbred heifers, steers and Friesian steers respectively. Crossbred heifers and steers took 86 and 59 days longer respectively than Friesian steers to reach slaughter weight. Killing-out percentages of the crossbred heifers and steers were 67.6 and 67.3 compared with 66.6 for Friesians. Crossbred steer carcasses at 270 kg contained 1.6% more 'lean meat' and 1.5% less bone compared to Friesian steer carcasses at 234 kg; the carcass fat levels at 21% were identical in both groups. Crossbred heifers had less 'lean meat' and more fat than crossbred steers. Intramuscular fat content of the longissimus dorsi was similar in crossbred and Friesian steers.

Analysis of these dual consumption/investment roles suggests the permanent wealth budget constraint in housing demand models should be decomposed into permanent returns from human capital and current net worth. For young owners, current net worth is hypothesized to be the dominant wealth component determining the quantity of housing demanded. Using a Canadian microdata base, evidence is found that net worth does provide both greater explanatory power and higher elasticities than labor earnings.

Although institutional and sociological explanations of single-issue party strength have been dominant, they tend to remove parties from the analysis. In this article, I argue that the behavior of mainstream parties influences the electoral fortunes of the new, niche party actors. In contrast to standard spatial theories, my theory recognizes that party tactics work by altering the salience and ownership of issues for political competition, not just party issue positions. It follows that niche party support can be shaped by both proximal and non-proximal competitors. Analysis of green and radical right party vote in 17 Western European countries from 1970 to 2000 confirms that mainstream party strategies matter; the modified spatial theory accounts for the failure and success of niche parties across countries and over time better than institutional, sociological, and even standard spatial explanations.

Comes	New Phytologist	169	2	2006-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 431-441	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		• The analysis of hybrid plant taxa using molecular methods has considerably extended understanding of possible pathways of hybrid evolution. • Here, we investigated the origin of the tetraploid Senecio mohavensis ssp. breviflorus and the hexaploid Senecio hoggariensis by sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast DNA, and by analysis of the distribution of taxon-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments. • Both taxa originated from hybridization between the diploid Senecio flavus and Senecio glaucus. Whereas S. glaucus was the female parent in the origin of S. mohavensis ssp. breviflorus, S. flavus was the female parent in the origin of S. hoggariensis. • The distribution of AFLP fragments suggests that S. hoggariensis is an allohexaploid species with two diploid genomes of S. glaucus and one diploid genome of S. flavus. The high frequency of S. flavus-specific fragments in S. mohavensis ssp. breviflorus is explained either as the result of introgression between a primary hybrid and S. flavus or as the result of intergenomic recombination in a primary hybrid. These two alternative processes cannot easily be distinguished.

KNOX LOVELL	Journal of Productivity Analysis	2	4	1992-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 283-298		fla		Caves, Christensen and Diewert [1982a] showed that the Törnqvist productivity index is superlative in a considerably more general sense than had been previously believed. We examine the allocative and technical efficiency hypotheses on which their finding rests. We show that the allocative efficiency hypothesis can be modified, which makes the Törnqvist index superlative in a wider sense than even Caves, Christensen and Diewert showed, since it is consistent with a type of allocative efficiency other than the standard cost minimization and revenue maximization hypotheses considered by Caves, Christensen and Diewert. We also show that if the technical efficiency hypothesis is relaxed, the CCD result may no longer hold, and the distance functions that form the basis of the Malmquist productivity indexes, and hence of the Törnqvist productivity index, must be calculated. We then show how to calculate the underlying distance functions, and we argue that there are real advantages to doing so.

The method is applied to two empirical examples: the debate over long cycles and the effect of domestic politics on foreign policy decision making.

The positions of 14 species from three taxonomic families and three different habitats in a phenotypic space defined by 19 traits provided measures of taxonomic and ecological similarity. The distribution of phenotypic distances among species revealed that neither taxonomy nor habitat overwhelmingly determined phenotype. There appear to be multiple ways in which anurans can exploit pond types. However, the direction of phenotypic movement was not random from one species to the next. Independent contrasts revealed significant correlations in the evolution of traits that were consistent among lineages. These correlations reflected well‐known trade‐offs that result from functional relationships among the constituent traits. Although there is no simple pattern in the distribution of mean phenotypes across environments and lineages, the pattern of the evolutionary trajectories that created that distribution is consistent with a predictive theory of multivariate evolution.

However, few data are available on whether ozone modifies temperature effects. This study aims to explore whether ozone modified associations between maximum temperature and cardiovascular mortality in the USA. Methods: The authors obtained data from the US National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) website. They used two time-series Poisson regression models (a response surface model and a stratification model) to examine whether ozone modified associations between maximum temperature and cardiovascular mortality (CVM) in 95 large US communities during 1987-2000 in summer (June to September). Bayesian meta-analysis was used to pool estimates in each community. Results: The response surface model was used to examine the joint effects of temperature and ozone on CVM in summer. Results indicate that ozone positively modified the temperature-CVM associations across the different regions. The stratification model quantified the temperature-CVM associations across different levels of ozone. Results show that in general the higher the ozone concentration, the stronger the temperature-CVM associations across the communities. A 10°C increase in temperature on the same day was associated with an increase in CVM by 1.17% and 8.31% for the lowest and highest level of ozone concentrations in all communities, respectively. Conclusion: Ozone modified temperature effects in different regions in the USA. It is important to evaluate the modifying role of ozone when estimating temperaturerelated health impacts and to further investigate the reasons behind the regional variability and mechanism for the interaction between temperature and ozone.

Objective: To assess state-based changes in Hispanics' access to physicians and preventive services from 1991 to 2004. Methods: Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in the 10 states with the largest Hispanic populations, we examined 4 preventive services for eligible adults (mammography, Papanicolaou testing, colorectal cancer screening, and cholesterol testing) and 2 measures of access to physicians (obtaining routine checkup in prior 2 years and avoiding seeing physician when needed due to cost in prior year). In each state we assessed unadjusted and adjusted Hispanic-white access gaps and changes over time. Results: Hispanic-white access gaps persisted over time and varied widely by state. Disparities narrowed and became nonsignificant in 2 states (Arizona and California) for mammography and 3 states (Nevada, New Mexico, and New York) for Pap testing. Other disparities increased and became significant (mammography in Texas; colorectal cancer screening in California, Colorado, and Texas; cholesterol testing in Florida and Nevada; routine checkups in Arizona and New Mexico). Disparities in lacking doctor visits due to cost remained large and significant over time in all states. Insurance status and education were the main contributors to Hispanic-white disparities and their impact increased over time. Conclusions: Although use of preventive services and access to physicians improved for both whites and Hispanics nationally, access gaps varied widely among states.

Huey	Evolution	49	4	1995-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 676-684	Society for the Study of Evolution	fla		We investigated the heat tolerance of adults of three replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster that have been evolving independently by laboratory natural selection for 15 yr at "nonextreme" temperatures (18⚬C, 25⚬C, or 28⚬C). These lines are known to have diverged in body size and in the thermal dependence of several life-history traits. Here we show that they differ also in tolerance of extreme high temperature as well as in induced thermotolerance ("heat hardening"). For example, the 28⚬C flies had the highest probability of surviving a heat shock, whereas the 18⚬C flies generally had the lowest probability. A short heat pretreatment increased the heat tolerance of the 18⚬C and 25⚬C lines, and the threshold temperature necessary to induce thermotolerance was lower for the 18⚬C line than for the 25⚬C line. However, neither heat pretreatment nor acclimation to different temperatures influenced heat tolerance of the 28⚬C line, suggesting the loss of capacity for induced thermotolerance and for acclimation. Thus, patterns of tolerance of extreme heat, of acclimation, and of induced thermotolerance have evolved as correlated responses to natural selection at nonextreme temperatures. A genetic analysis of heat tolerance of a representative replicate population each from the 18⚬C and 28⚬C lines indicates that chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 have significant effects on heat tolerance. However, the cytoplasm has little influence, contrary to findings in an earlier study of other stocks that had been evolving for 7 yr at 14⚬C versus 25⚬C. Because genes for heat stress proteins (hsps) are concentrated on chromosome 3, the potential role of hsps in the heat tolerance and of induced thermotolerance in these naturally selected lines is currently unclear. In any case, species of Drosophila possess considerable genetic variation in thermal sensitivity and thus have the potential to evolve rapidly in response to climate change; but predicting that response may be difficult.

Methods: In-person interviews on sexual health issues were conducted with 704 never-married youth aged 12-24 in three Ghanaian towns. The sample included youth who were in school, in apprenticeship programs or in neither school nor apprenticeship programs (unaffiliated). Results: More than half of the respondents had ever had sexual intercourse (52%), with the adjusted odds for females being 1.6 times those for males and the odds for unaffiliated and apprenticed youth being 2.5-3.2 times those for in-school youth. The odds of having had sex in the previous month were elevated for females (2.0) and apprentices (2.7). Both sexes tended to accept violence towards women, with unaffiliated youth showing the highest level of acceptance and in-school youth the lowest. Nearly all respondents (99%) knew of condoms, but fewer than half (48%) could identify any of four elements of correct use; females and sexually inexperienced youth were the least informed. Two-thirds of respondents considered it unacceptable for males to carry condoms, and three-quarters considered it unacceptable for females. Twenty-five percent of males and 8% of females reported having had a sexually transmitted infection. One-third of sexually experienced females reported having ever been pregnant; of those, 70% reported having had or having attempted to have an abortion. Conclusions: Adolescent reproductive health programs should be targeted to the needs of specific groups. /// [Spanish] Contexto: Los jóvenes de Ghana se ven muy afectados por los grandes cambios sociales, y sus necesidades en materia de salud reproductiva pueden diferir de acuerdo con el grupo social, de edad y de género a que pertenecen. Métodos: Se realizaron entrevistas personales sobre cuestiones de salud sexual a una muestra de 704 jóvenes que nunca se habían casado, de 12-24 años, en tres pueblos de Ghana. Esta muestra incluyó a jóvenes que asistían a la escuela, a programas de aprendizaje, o que simplemente no asistían a ninguno de esos centros de formación (no afiliados). Resultados: Más de la mitad de los entrevistados habían tenido relaciones sexuales alguna vez (52%); la razón de momios ajustada para las mujeres era de 1,6 en comparación con los hombres, y la de los no afiliados y miembros de los centros de aprendizaje eran de 2,5-3,2, en comparación con aquellos jóvenes que asistían a la escuela. Las probabilidades de haber tenido relaciones sexuales durante el mes previo a la encuesta fueron elevadas entre las mujeres (2,0) y los que asistían a los centros de aprendizaje (2,7). Aproximadamente el 25% de las entrevistadas que tenían experiencia sexual indicaron que su primera relación sexual había sido una violación o un acto forzado, y el 9% indicaron que habían sido engatusadas o engañadas; el 20% de los hombres informaron que habían recurrido a la coerción o al soborno para iniciar una relación sexual. Ambos grupos, hombres y mujeres, aceptaron que había violencia hacia la mujer y el grupo de jóvenes no afiliados presentó el nivel más elevado de aceptación, en tanto el grupo que asistía a la escuela tenía el más bajo. Casi todos los entrevistados (99%) conocían el condón, pero menos de la mitad (48%) podían identificar alguno de los cuatro elementos que corresponden al uso correcto de este anticonceptivo; las mujeres y los jóvenes con menos experiencia sexual fueron los menos informados al respecto. Los dos tercios de los entrevistados consideraron inaceptable que los hombres tuvieran condones a su disposición, y las tres cuartas partes también consideraron inaceptable que las mujeres tuvieran este método en su poder. El 25% de los hombres y el 8% de las mujeres indicaron que habían tenido una enfermedad transmitida sexualmente. Un tercio de las mujeres que tenían experiencia sexual habían quedado embarazadas; el 87% de estos embarazos eran no deseados. Conclusiones: Los programas de salud reproductiva dirigidos a los adolescentes deberían centrar la atención en las necesidades de grupos específicos. /// [French] Contexte: L'évolution sociale a affecté grandement les jeunes Ghanéens, et leurs besoins de santé génésique peuvent différer selon le groupe social, l'âge et le sexe. Méthodes: Des entrevues personnelles sur les questions de la santé sexuelle ont été menées avec 704 jeunes célibataires âgés de 12 à 24 ans dans trois villes ghanéennes. L'échantillon comprenait des jeunes scolarisés, inscrits à un programme d'apprentissage ou ni l'un ni l'autre (non affiliés). Résultats: Plus de la moitié des répondants avaient déjà eu des rapports sexuels (52%), la cote corrigée pour les filles représentant 1,6 fois celle des garçons, et la cote corrigée des jeunes non affiliés ou apprentis représentant 2,5 à 3,2 fois celle des jeunes scolarisés. La probabilité d'avoir eu des rapports sexuels durant le mois précédant l'entrevue était élevée pour les filles (2,0) et les apprentis (2,7). Près de 25% des répondantes sexuellement expérimentées ont déclaré que leur première expérience sexuelle avait été le produit d'un viol ou d'une contrainte, et 9% ont dit avoir été leurrées ou trompées; 20% des garçons ont déclaré avoir eu recours à la ruse ou la coercition pour obtenir des faveurs sexuelles. Dans les deux sexes, la tendance était à l'acceptation de la violence à l'égard des femmes, les jeunes non affiliés présentant le plus haut niveau d'acceptation et ceux scolarisés, le moindre. Presque tous les répondants (99%) avaient connaissance du préservatif, mais moins de la moitié (48%) pouvaient identifier l'un quelconque des quatre éléments de son usage correct. Les filles et les jeunes sans expérience sexuelle étaient les moins informés. Deux tiers des répondants jugeaient inacceptable qu'un garçon ait sur lui des préservatifs, et trois quarts considéraient inacceptable qu'une fille s'en munisse. Vingt-cinq pour cent des garçons et 8% des filles ont déclaré avoir eu une infection sexuellement transmissible. Un tiers des filles sexuellement expérimentées ont déclaré avoir été enceintes; 87% de ces grossesses n'étaient pas désirées. Conclusions: Les programmes de santé génésique des adolescents devraient être ciblés sur les besoins et le vécu de groupes spécifiques.

It is established that growth in 1908-14 was most marked in capital goods and that a likely explanation may be found in the upsurge of defence spending. In real terms, total defence outlays increased by c. 50 per cent in this period, while a rising proportion was directed to armaments purchases from domestic suppliers, who re-equipped in order to cope. This picture is confirmed by evidence from major firms and from are construction of the pattern of iron and steel consumption. There is little evidence of the decisive importance of household consumption for renewed growth which, Gerschenkron argued, substituted for  state support.

Douglass	Management International Review	16	1	1976-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 79-87	Springer	fla		The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between firm performance and environmental interaction. Firm performance was measured by changes in sales over five years, and changes in net profit over five years. Firms were classified as either high, medium, or low performers on both sales and profits measures. The unit of study was the firm. The approach viewed the firm as a total system interacting with its environment. Environmental interaction was measured in terms of four systems flows across seven environmental interfaces. The four flows consisted of the movement of men, money, material, and information. The environmental interfaces included government, customers, suppliers, competitors, labor, stockholders, and other institutions. The sample included forty-six U.S. subsidiary and Danish firms in a paired-comparison design. Seventeen industries were represented. Data was collected through interviews with top managers and through questionnaires completed by top managers and other key personnel. Many of the system flow and interface variables were significantly correlated with changes in sales and net profits. Correlation patterns were different between high, medium, and low performance firms. The greatest surprise was the number of negative correlations. All signiłicant correlations for high performance firms were negative. The number of significant positive correlations was higher for low performance firms then for medium performance firms. /// Le but de cette étude était d'examiner la relation entre la performance de l'entreprise et son interaction dans l'environnement.

Les sociétés ont été classées selon leur performance, qui était soit haute, moyenne ou basse tant par rapport aux ventes qu'aux bénéfices. L'unité d'études était la société. L'approche a considéré la firme comme un système total en interaction avec son environnement et cette dernière a été mesurée en des termes de quatre flux de systèmes à travers sept secteurs d'environnement. Les quatre flux couvraient le mouvement d'hommes, d'argent, de matériel et d'information. Les secteurs de l'environnement comprenaient le gouvernement, les clients, les fournisseurs, les concurrents, la main-d'œuvre, les actionnaires et d'autres institutions. L'échantillon a compris quarante-six succursales américaines et firmes danoises, la technique utilisée était celle de comparaison par paires. Dix-sept industries y étaient représentées. Les données ont été recueillies par des interviews avec des cadres supérieurs et par des questionnaires complétés par des cadres supérieurs et d'autres membres de personnel dans des situations-clefs. De nombreuses variables du flux de système et du secteur de l'environnement étaient en corrélation significative avec les changements dans les ventes et les profits nets. Les modèles de corrélation étaient différents entre les firmes à performance haute, moyenne et basse. La plus grande surprise fut le nombre de corrélations négatives. Toutes les corrélations importantes pour les sociétés à haute performance étaient négatives. Le nombre de correlations positives importantes était plus élevé pour les firmes à basse performance que pour celles à performance moyenne. /// Gegenstand dieses Beitrags ist die Überprüfung des Einflusses von Umweltbeziehungen der Unternehmung auf ihre Leistung. Diese wurde anhand von Veränderungen der Umsatzzahlen und des Nettogewinns über fünf Jahre hinweg gemessen. Aufgrund der Messungsergebnisse wurden die in der Stichprobe enthaltenen 64 dänischen US-Niederlassungen und rein dänischen Firmen aus 17 Branch en in hoch-, mittel- und wenig effiziente Unternehmen aufgegliedert. Unter methodischer Anwendung des Systemansatzes wurde die Unternehmung als ein mit der Umwelt interagierendes System betrachtet. Die Umweltbeziehungen wurden anhand von vier Systemtransaktionen mit sieben Umweltsegmenten gemessen, wobei erstere die Bewegung von Menschen, Geld, Material und Informationen, letztere die Regierung, Kunden, Lieferanten, Wettbewerber, den Arbeitsmarkt, die Aktionäre und sonstige Institutionen urnfassen. Die Datensammlung erfolgte über Befragungen von Vorstandsmitgliedern und Führungskräften der nächsten £bene in schriftlicher Form. Im Ergebnis zeigten sich signifikante Korrelationen zwischen Änderungen in den Effizienzvariablen und vielen der Interaktionsvariablen, wobei Unterschiede zwischen Firmen mit hohem, mittlerem und niedrigem Leistungsergebnis feststellbar waren. Überraschend war die Vielzahl der negativen Korrelationen, unter die z. B. alle signifikanten Korrelationsmaße für effiziente Unternehmen fielen. Die Anzahl der signifikanten positiven Korrelationen war für wenig effiziente Firmen größer als für jene mit nur mittelmäßiger Leistung.

Neumann, Paul Nurse	The Journal of Cell Biology	179	4	2007-11-19T00:00:00Z	pp. 593-600	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		A long-standing biological question is how a eukaryotic cell controls the size of its nucleus. We report here that in fission yeast, nuclear size is proportional to cell size over a 35-fold range, and use mutants to show that a 16-fold change in nuclear DNA content does not influence the relative size of the nucleus. Multi-nucleated cells with unevenly distributed nuclei reveal that nuclei surrounded by a greater volume of cytoplasm grow more rapidly. During interphase of the cell cycle nuclear growth is proportional to cell growth, and during mitosis there is a rapid expansion of the nuclear envelope. When the nuclear/cell (N/C) volume ratio is increased by centrifugation or genetic manipulation, nuclear growth is arrested while the cell continues to grow; in contrast, low N/C ratios are rapidly corrected by nuclear growth. We propose that there is a general cellular control linking nuclear growth to cell size.

Grau	The Auk	106	1	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 86-93	American Ornithologists' Union, University of California Press	fla		In some monogamous birds random force-pairing of mates results in successful reproduction. In addition, prior social experience with a mate may enhance subsequent reproductive success. We investigated the influence of force-pairing and prior pair association on reproductive activity in Cockatiels stimulated to breed by long daylengths and nest-box access. Birds force-paired at the onset of long days had reduced reproductive activity compared to birds force-paired prior to long days. Both groups of force-paired birds displayed less activity than established control pairs. Birds force-paired prior to long days but then reunited with former mates at the onset of long days did not show impaired reproductive activity compared with controls. We show that force-pairing can lead to some breeding activity in this species and that mate familiarity improves the reproductive activity resulting from force-pairing. Furthermore, pairs with histories of breeding do not require continuous mate access to maintain pair bonds.

Ages of clades within Hordeum were estimated using a penalized likelihood analysis of sequence divergence. • The sequence data resulted in an almost fully resolved phylogenetic tree that allowed the reconstruction of intrageneric migration routes. Hordeum evolved c. 12 million years ago in South-west Asia and spread into Europe and Central Asia. The colonization of the New World and South Africa involved at least six intercontinental exchanges during the last 4 million years (twice Eurasia-North America, North America-South America, twice South America-North America and Europe-South Africa). • Repeated long-distance dispersal between the northern and southern hemisphere were important colonization mechanisms in Hordeum.

Dillon	Northeastern Naturalist	19	4	2012-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 673-684	Eagle Hill Institute	fla		Callophrys irus (Frosted Elfin) is threatened under New York State conservation law and has fewer than 5 secure populations within the state. Published research on these populations is needed to support the development of a state recovery plan and monitoring program for the species. We assessed the relationship between adult occupancy (patch use) in the Albany Pine Bush Preserve and a suite of potential controlling factors. We then used the results in a simulation framework to quantitatively inform how many sites and surveys are needed for Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring. Patch use was best explained by a model that assumed the same occupancy probability for each patch. The species was more likely to use patches with limited shrub cover and greater host plant density, yet showed a good chance (>76%) of using even the smaller patches (<1 ha) with relatively sparse density (<1000 ramets ha⁻¹). Detection probability depended primarily on observer and survey date, ranging from 0.34 to 0.94 among observers and from 0.35 to 0.96 across surveys. In the worst-case scenario (i.e., low detectability and low intrinsic occupancy rate), minimum effort for adult Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring in habitat similar to the Albany Pine Bush may require at least 20 habitat patches surveyed 6 times each or at least 10 habitat patches surveyed 8 times each. Less effort (e.g., 10 sites x 4 surveys) will likely suffice if surveys are restricted to the period of peak abundance. Adult occupancy (or patch use) is probably the most efficient state variable for monitoring Frosted Elfin populations, and changes in detection-corrected occupancy rate or proportion of area occupied could be useful for conservation planning.

Data was obtained regarding two sources of job demands (intrinsic and extrinsic), three psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression and irritation), four categories of personality and three areas of social support. Using hierarchical regression procedures (Arnold 1982) the results suggest that the effects of social support vary significantly depending upon the source of job demands, the workers' personality and the psychological symptom manifested.

Item-response distributions, internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, criterion-related validity and construct validity through confirmatory analysis were analyzed. The findings indicate that the WHOQOL-BREF had acceptable internal consistency (α = 0.73–0.83 across four domains), all items highly correlated with corresponding domain scores (r = 0.53–0.80), the indices of a two-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrate that the data fit the model well with allowing covary of error variances of some items, all items had good property of criterion-related validity and item discrimination and, all three domain scores except the social relationship domain had significant associations with overall QoL or general health. The results suggest that the WHOQOL-BREF was reliable and valid to health professionals in the assessment of the QoL of college-based Thai youth, but some unsuitable items may be deleted in future studies.

In this paper, I examine first, the emergence of the idea of New Bombay and the interest groups who influenced the planning process. Secondly, I examine the actual achievements of the New Bombay project and the disjuncture between planning and reality. The New Bombay case shows clearly the way the political environment can influence the planning process. Confronted with the demands of different interest groups, the state in its urban planning opted for a solution which would accommodate all of them. In the process, many of the original objectives of building the new city have remained unfulfilled.

We investigated levels of naturally acquired antibody to conserved and variable regions of merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 and MSP-2, apical membrane antigen (AMA)-1, and rhoptryassociated protein 1 in plasma samples from 126 children admitted to the hospital with CM, 59 with SMA, and 84 with uncomplicated malaria (UM) in Malawi. Children with SMA were distinguished by very low levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G to the conserved C-terminus of MSP-1 and MSP-2 and to full-length AMA-1. Conversely, children with CM had significantly higher levels of IgG to the conserved regions of all antigens examined than did children with UM (for MSP-1 and AMA-1, P<.005; for MSP-2, P<.05) or SMA (for MSP-1 and MSP-2, P<.001; for AMA-1, P<.005). These distinct IgG patterns might reflect differences in age, exposure to P. falciparum, and/or genetic factors affecting immune responses.

It satisfies linear homogeneity (in prices) property and is flexible in the output space. Thus the function is ideal for estimating, for example, economies of scope, cost complementarity, product-specific returns to scale, etc., without worrying about zero values of output(s) and extrapolations to points far from the point of approximation. As an empirical application, we use panel data (1978-1985) on 12 Finnish foundry plants to estimate technical progress, overall returns to scale, product-specific returns to scale and economies of scope.

The pool size of C in the forest floor ranged from 1.1 kg/m2 to 4.4 kg/m2 while the N content of the forest floor ranged from 83 g/m2 to 229 g/m2. Forest floor C and N pools were smallest beneath sugar maple and highest beneath hemlock. Soil C:N ratios (range: 14.8-19.5) were lower beneath sugar maple, red maple, and white ash than beneath beech, red oak, and hemlock, whereas the opposite was true of the midsummer rate of net N mineralization (range: 0.91-2.02 g·m-2·28 d-1). The rate of net nitrification was positively correlated with the rate of net N mineralization. Interspecific differences in litter production and quality explain the large differences among species in the size of the forest floor C and N pools and in net N mineralization rates. The differences in the size and distribution of C and N pools beneath the different species suggest that the mechanisms regulating the process of species replacement in these forests will mediate the effects of anthropogenic, environmental changes in soil C and N dynamics.

All the women life in a metropolitan area in America. The conclusion is that urbanization and industrialization trends make formal education a major requirement for the social engagement of women. The less educated an urban woman, the more probable her social isolation. This variable is more important than any other in predicting the degree to which a woman is able to engage in society and her attitude toward her social world.

Gilsdorf, Scott E. Hygnstrom	The Journal of Wildlife Management	73	3	2009-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 339-344	Wildlife Society, Wiley	fla		The expansion of the cellulosic biofuels industry throughout the United States has broad-scale implications for wildlife management on public and private lands. Knowledge is limited on the effects of reverting agriculture to native grass, and vice versa, on size of home range and habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We followed 68 radiocollared female deer from 1991 through 2004 that were residents of DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) in eastern Nebraska, USA. The refuge was undergoing conversion of vegetation out of row-crop agriculture and into native grass, forest, and emergent aquatic vegetation. Habitat in DNWR consisted of 30% crop in 1991 but removing crops to establish native grass and wetland habitat at DNWR resulted in a 44% reduction in crops by 2004. A decrease in the amount of crops on DNWR contributed to a decline in mean size of annual home range from 400 ha in 1991 to 200 ha in 2005 but percentage of crops in home ranges increased from 21% to 29%. Mean overlap for individuals was 77% between consecutive annual home ranges across 8 years, regardless of crop availability. Conversion of crop to native habitat will not likely result in home range abandonment but may impact disease transmission by increasing rates of contact between deer social groups that occupy adjacent areas. Future research on condition indices or changes in population parameters (e.g., recruitment) could be incorporated into the study design to assess impacts of habitat conversion for biofuel production.

Sutherland	Journal of Applied Ecology	49	1	2012-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 99-108	British Ecological Society	fla		1. European agriculture is facing dramatic changes that are likely to have marked impacts on farmland biodiversity. There is an urgent need to develop land management strategies compatible with the conservation of biodiversity. 2. We applied a spatially explicit behaviour-based model to assess how farmland management and the pattern of events across the annual farming calendar influences the foraging decisions of lesser kestrels Falco naumanni in a cereal steppe landscape. Moreover, we simulated the most likely scenarios of future agricultural changes to predict its impacts on lesser kestrel breeding success. Lesser kestrels have been the subject of serious conservation concern and constitute a good model species to judge impacts on farmland species more widely. 3. Our results show that the location of cereal and fallow patches within a 2-km radius of a kestrel colony influences the total food supply delivered to the nestlings, explaining the differences in breeding success between years and colonies. Furthermore, the particular sequence in which patches are harvested by farmers is also predicted to influence offspring survival. 4. Agricultural intensification, simulated by increasing the proportion of cereal fields, is predicted to negatively influence breeding success. However, the field harvesting sequence can play an important role in alleviating the effects of the increased percentage of cereal, as demonstrated by the higher breeding success obtained when harvesting starts from patches farthest from the colonies. The replacement of cereal cultivation by low-intensity grazed fallows would not be detrimental for kestrels. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the effectiveness of behaviour-based models to evaluate the interacting effect of spatial and temporal dynamics of agricultural landscapes and predict the response of populations to environmental change. To optimize food availability for lesser kestrels, land managers should implement long rotational schemes with < 60% of the area under extensive cereal cultivation in a 2-km radius around colonies. Harvesting should start in the cereal patches farthest from colonies. Ideally, the predominant land use around colonies should be fallows. These outcomes illustrate how behaviour-based models can be applied to identify specific management recommendations that would improve the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes, the most accepted tool for maintaining farmland landscapes.

However, the scales of the chilled bulbs exhibited higher water content, faster starch degradation and increased concentrations of sucrose and ethanol-soluble fructan. Quantitative measurements of magnetization transfer (MT) indicated a smaller fraction of a solid or a restricted-mobility proton pool in the scales of the chilled bulbs. By contrast, the MT effect was significantly higher in the central bud of the chilled than in the nonchilled bulbs. • Degradation of storage polysaccharides to low-molecular-weight sugar molecules during release from dormancy could be accompanied by local release of water molecules tightly bound to the polysaccharide granules into the bulk water, or by an influx of free water molecules due to increased osmotic potential caused by the raised sugar concentration, or by a combination of both effects.

These successful patietns received both positive and negative feedback, primarily from other group members, and worked effectively toward the goals that brought them to treatment.

In this paper, I develop a behavioral typology based on students' course-taking and other enrollment patterns during a seven-year observation period. Drawing on data for a population of 165,921 first-time college students, I identify six clusters of behaviors: transfer, vocational, drop-in, noncredit, experimental, and exploratory. I describe each of these student types in terms of distinguishing course-taking and enrollment behaviors, representation in the first-time student cohort, predominant demographic characteristics, and self-reported academic goal. I test the predictive validity of the classification scheme with respect to long-term academic outcomes. I investigate the relationships between the primary classification scheme and several alternative classification schemes. Finally, I demonstrate the replicability of the classification scheme with an alternate cohort of students.

Shugart	Journal of Biogeography	32	9	2005-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1641-1658	Wiley	fla		Aim This paper describes the forest gap model, FAREAST, its testing and its application to simulating the distribution, composition and dynamics of forests in eastern Eurasia. Location The FAREAST model is tested in north-eastern China, initially for forests on the elevational gradient of Changbai Mountain, which is located on the border of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Subsequently, the model is inspected regionally for other northern Chinese mountains and, finally, it is applied to predict subcontinental forest communities in the Russian Far East. Boreal larch (Larix spp.) forests cover much of the 6 million km2 of eastern Eurasia. Mixed broad-leaved tree species/Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forests and spruce/fir (Picea/Abies) forests also occupy considerable areas. Methods The model is tested using three types of information: (1) direct species composition comparisons between simulated and observed mature forests at the same locations; (2) forest type comparisons between simulated and observed forests along altitudinal gradients of several different mountains; and (3) comparison with forest stands in different succession stages of simulated forests. Results Model comparisons with independent data indicate that the FAREAST model is capable of representing many of the broad features of the forests of north-eastern China. After regional model validation in the north-eastern region of China, geographical model applications were developed for the forests of the Russian Far East. In simulations at 31 different sites distributed across the entire Russian Far East and including a wide variety of natural forests, the model demonstrates an ability to reproduce observed vegetation pattern. The model simulations are correct with respect to our criteria for 23 of the 31 sites, and there are close results for three other sites. Among the five sites that are incorrectly predicted, four simulations can be corrected by adding a simple assumption to the model for permafrost effects on water balance. Main conclusions Continental-scale forest cover can be simulated using a forest gap model to represent individual-plant interactions with one another, and their environment, and with parameters that describe the biology of each tree species. It appears that such a model, validated relatively locally (in this case, in north-eastern China), can then be applied over a much larger region. These results further imply that the Russian Far East forests can be regarded as a natural geographical expansion of north-eastern Chinese forests. In both regions, forests share not only similar species compositions, but also similar underlying causes of forest successional dynamics.

Whereas some scholars emphasize the mediating effects of procedures for political control of bureaucracy, other scholars highlight the actions and preferences of agencies. The present study combines both perspectives and argues that policy divergence is explained by political conflict in interaction with agency preferences. Political conflict is specified in conjunction with the decision-making context. Conflict among decisive legislators—rather than the legislature as a whole—is hypothesized to reinforce the effect of agency preferences on policy divergence. Using a cross-classified multilevel design, data on local policy making and implementation in the Netherlands offer support for these hypotheses and reveal that preferences of agencies and conflict among decisive legislators should be included in explanations for policy divergences in the implementation process.

These models incorporate reliable information on population structure and underlying dynamic mechanisms but use nonparametric surface‐fitting methods to avoid unsupported assumptions about the precise form of rate equations. Using historical data on measles epidemics as a case study, we show how this approach can lead to better forecasts, better characterizations of the dynamics, and a better understanding of the factors causing complex population dynamics relative to either mechanistic models or purely descriptive statistical time‐series models. The semimechanistic models are found to have better forecasting accuracy than either of the model types used in previous analyses when tested on data not used to fit the models. The dynamics are characterized as being both nonlinear and noisy, and the global dynamics are clustered very tightly near the border of stability (dominant Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0). However, locally in state space the dynamics oscillate between strong short‐term stability and strong short‐term chaos (i.e., between negative and positive local Lyapunov exponents). There is statistically significant evidence for short‐term chaos in all data sets examined. Thus the nonlinearity in these systems is characterized by the variance over state space in local measures of chaos versus stability rather than a single summary measure of the overall dynamics as either chaotic or nonchaotic.

Mathews	Oecologia	163	3	2010-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 601-612	International Association for Ecology, Springer	fla		The brown-headed cowbird (Molothms ater) is a generalist brood parasite that typically parasitizes many host species in a single bird community. Population recruitment in a generalist parasite should be diverse with respect to host species; however, host-specific rates of cowbird recruitment have not been reported in any host community, and the determinants of host quality are poorly known. We studied the combined influence of parasitism level, nest abundance, and host quality on community-level patterns of cowbird recruitment in New Mexico, USA. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate patterns of host use and quality; (2) compare cowbird egg investment and recruitment among host species; (3) identify host species of most importance to cowbird recruitment. Cowbirds parasitized 11 host species, with five "major" hosts experiencing high parasitism levels (≥1 cowbird egg/nest) and six minor hosts experiencing low parasitism levels (< 0.3 cowbird eggs/nest). Parasitism level was not correlated with host species abundance, host mass, host nestling period length, or host success at fledging cowbirds. However, tree-nesting hosts were parasitized more than ground-nesters, and foliage-gleaners more than sally-foragers and ground-foragers. Average estimated survival to fledging of cowbird eggs laid in active host nests was 0.19. Cowbird recruitment was diverse with respect to hosts but was less evenly distributed across the host community than was cowbird egg investment because western tanagers (Piranga ludovicianus) fledged cowbirds more successfully than other hosts. This success in western tanagers was due to high cowbird survivorship in tanager nests and may be associated with the larger body size of tanagers relative to other hosts.

This change is caused by the growing use of ICT and the scope of services they now cover. Since public administrations face higher demands from citizens and society -- higher level of services, lower costs of service production -- the ICT and internet are used to redesign, not only the service delivery process, but also the organisational structure of the organisations involved. In this article we introduce some benchmarks that show the growth path in this transformation and the use and scope of ICT, and we present a case study to illustrate changes in depth. We also try to analyse these changes, using classical literature from organisational sociology. Amendments to the work of Joan Woodward and Max Weber are proposed to deliver extra heuristic power to understand recent developments in organisational change.

Smith, John G. Williams	Ecological Applications	15	4	2005-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1427-1439	Ecological Society of America	fla		Capture-recapture studies are powerful tools for studying animal population dynamics, providing information on population abundance, survival rates, population growth rates, and selection for phenotypic traits. In these studies, the probability of observing a tagged individual reflects both the probability of the individual surviving to the time of recapture and the probability of recapturing an animal, given that it is alive. If both of these probabilities are related to the same phenotypic trait, it can be difficult to distinguish effects on survival probabilities from effects on recapture probabilities. However, when animals are individually tagged and have multiple opportunities for recapture, we can properly partition observed trait-related variability into survival and recapture components. We present an overview of capture-recapture models that incorporate individual variability and develop methods to incorporate results from these models into estimates of population survival and selection for phenotypic traits. We conducted a series of simulations to understand the performance of these estimators and to assess the consequences of ignoring individual variability when it exists. In addition, we analyzed a large data set of > 153 000 juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) of known length that were PIT-tagged during their seaward migration. Both our simulations and the case study indicated that the ability to precisely estimate selection for phenotypic traits was greatly compromised when differential recapture probabilities were ignored. Estimates of population survival, however, were far more robust. In the chinook salmon and steelhead study, we consistently found that smaller fish had a greater probability of recapture. We also uncovered length-related survival relationships in over half of the release group/river segment combinations that we observed, but we found both positive and negative relationships between length and survival probability. These results have important implications for the management of salmonid populations.

We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach to model effective connectivity assuming a dynamic nonstationary neuronal system. Our approach uses the Dirichlet process to specify an appropriate (most plausible according to our prior beliefs) dynamic model as the "expectation" of a set of plausible models upon which we assign a probability distribution. This addresses model uncertainty associated with dynamic effective connectivity. We derive a Gibbs sampling approach to sample from the joint (and marginal) posterior distributions of the unknowns. Results on simulation experiments demonstrate our model to be flexible and a better candidate in many situations.

UN Arms Embargoes in Civil Wars	Dominic Tierney	Review of International Studies	31	4	2005-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 645-664	Cambridge University Press	fla		UN arms embargoes have been increasingly applied to civil wars, yet these embargoes have tended to be either irrelevant or malevolent in their effects. Arms embargoes are rarely enforced in a civil war; they undermine the credibility of the UN; they are unlikely to change the political positions of civil war participants; they criminalise target societies; and they benefit arms suppliers willing to break the rules. This article argues for the reform of partial arms embargoes, which target select groups in a civil war. It also argues for the restriction in use of impartial embargoes, which apply to all sides in a civil war. Enforcing impartial embargoes can actually make the situation worse, by shaping the course of the civil war in unpredictable and immoral ways.

Preston	American Journal of Political Science	31	4	1987-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 773-795	Midwest Political Science Association	fla		Bureaucracy is a necessary and important part of our personal and collective lives. An authoritative system of decision, the predictability of established rules and fixed jurisdictional areas, and a technical division of labor make it possible for relevant expertise to resolve complex social and technological problems. But bureaucratic organization is also thought to deny freedom. I argue that a substantial degree of freedom is possible within the context of bureaucracy. The presumed conflict between freedom and bureaucracy exists because we have used an inadequate conception of freedom and adopted an excessively rigid view of bureaucracy. Understanding freedom as the ability to make deliberate choices, I contend that individuals' basic choices (technical, formal, and substantive) are notably free within a bureaucratic context. This claim is supported by examining the basic structure and process of bureaucracy as proposed by alternative types of organization theory.

Mitchley	Journal of Ecology	76	2	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 341-350	British Ecological Society	fla		(1) The vertical distribution of leaves was recorded using a point quadrat, at intervals throughout 1981 and 1982 from grazed chalk grasslands in Sussex and Wiltshire; the data were analysed to describe the overtopping relationships between leaves of different species. (2) In most cases there was a positive correlation between the relative height of rosette leaves of each species (`relative leaf position') and their relative abundance. (3) Despite the short turf of these chalk grasslands (< 10 cm excluding inflorescence stalks) there is pronounced vertical structure; the tallest species (often graminoids) tend to be the most abundant, and the shortest species (often dicotyledons) the least abundant. (4) It is suggested that relative abundance is partly determined by competition for light and that there is a steady-state relationship between species with taller and with shorter rosette leaves. The balance between species is determined by grazing with taller species favoured between grazing events and the shorter species at the time of grazing. (5) In grazed chalk grasslands in southern England, the balance falls in favour of species with taller and widely spreading growth-forms because grazing intensity is low and there is often a long time between successive grazing periods. (6) The species with shorter growth-forms persist, and the species with taller growth-forms do not come to ecological dominance, because of chronic, differential defoliation.

The number of seedlings in the natural stands of P. brutia was 1124/ha against 3188/ha in the burned area. In both cases natural regeneration was successful. Under the canopy of P. brutia forests the predominant shrubs were Quercus coccifera and Phillyrea latifolia. A high percentage (up to 40%) of the total area was covered by these species. In the burned areas, 12 yr after the wildfire of 1985, Cistus incanus and C. salvifolius played a significant role in the survival of P. brutia seedlings. These species had covered the burned area long before the pine seed germination.

Zwieniecki	American Journal of Botany	97	12	2010-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 2007-2019	Botanical Society of America	fla		Premise of the study: Ferns are an important component of both tropical and temperate forests; yet, our understanding of the water relations of their sporophyte generation is limited. Indeed, to date there has been no large scale survey that attempts to clarify how ferns fit into current ideas of plant water relations. This study examines several tropical ferns with the goal of understanding how these characters vary between species from various habitats and across life forms Methods: We measured stipe hydraulic conductivity, water potential, and vulnerability to cavitation along with photosynthetic variables and leaf allometry of 21 species from 14 genera to identify physiological trait assemblages across taxa.                Key results: Epiphytic ferns have significantly lower hydraulic conductivity and a vascular system more resistant to cavitation (i.e., higher P₅₀ values). They reached lower mid-day water potentials and produced leaves with reduced stipe lengths and reduced laminar area relative to terrestrial species. Xylem specific hydraulic conductivity (K               S               ) was correlated with the mean hydraulic diameter of tracheids in terrestrial species, but not in epiphytes. There was no evidence of safety—efficiency trade-offs in any group.              Conclusions: When compared across life forms, our data shed light on physiological mechanisms that may have allowed for terrestrial ferns to move into the epiphytic habit. When compared across a diverse assemblage of terrestrial plants, we find that resistance to water flow in fern stipes is significantly higher than that recorded from the stems of seed plants.

Crone	Journal of Animal Ecology	81	3	2012-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 724-734	British Ecological Society	fla		1. Two aspects of landscape composition shape the behavioural response of animals to habitat heterogeneity: physical habitat structure and abundance of key resources. In general, withinhabitat movement behaviour has been investigated in relation to resources, and preference at boundaries has been quantified in response to physical structure. 2. Habitat preference studies suggest that responses to resources vs. structure should differ, e. g. between male and female animals, and effects of responses to structure and resources may also interact. However, most studies of animal movement combine various aspects of behavioural responses to 'habitat', implicitly assuming that resources and structure are broadly equivalent. 3. We conducted a large-scale experiment of the movement of Fender's blue (Icaricia icarioides fended), an endangered butterfly, to investigate butterfly response to physical structure of the landscape (prairie, open woods and dense woods) and to resources [presence or absence of Kincaid's lupine, Lupinus oreganus (larval hostplant patches)]. The experiment included 606 butterfly flight paths across four habitat types and nine ecotones. 4. Responses to physical structure and resource patches were not congruent. Butterflies were attracted to resource patches within both prairies and open woods and moved more slowly when in resource patches. Butterflies tended to prefer prairie at prairie-forest edges but tended to move faster in prairies than in open woods. Physical structure and resources also interacted; butterflies did not respond to physical habitat structure when resource patches spanned prairie -open woods ecotones. 5. Even dense woods were not perfect barriers, in contrast to a large body of literature that assumes insects from open habitats will not enter dense forests. 6. Movement of both males and females responded to resources and structure. However, female butterflies had stronger responses to both resources and structure in most cases. Females had strongest response to resource (hostplant) patches at patch edges, whereas the strongest preference of males was to return to prairie from open forest. 7. If other species behave like Fender's blue, then combining different definitions of ' habitat' (physical structure vs. resources), different aspects of movement (edge preference vs. within-habitat movement) and/or males and females within species could all lead to misleading conclusions. Our results highlight the importance of investigating these responses, and our study provides a framework for separating them in other systems.

Standard methods exist for when the data are normal, and simple methods have been developed for nonnormal data without covariates. The dynamic generalized linear model (DGLM) may be considered a standard for nonnormal data with covariates, but perhaps one that is overcomplicated for many contexts. We propose adapting the standard exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to take into account the effect of risk factors. By approximating the correct exponential family likelihood, we derive a risk-adjusted EWMA (RA—EWMA) that is essentially a standard EWMA applied to "Pseudo-observations," which are the original observations adjusted for differential risk. The RA—EWMA can be expressed as a type of filter, in which current estimate = previous estimate + discounted predictive error. We review Bayesian state-space models related to the EWMA and examine the properties of each. The RA—EWMA and DGLM are compared algebraically, through simulation and an example. In the example, the expected mortality after surgery by a particular surgeon is allowed to vary over time and is estimated through the RA—EWMA. Each binary observation is adjusted for the effect of patient-specific risk factors to standardize information fed into the estimator for the expected mortality for a "Baseline" patient. The tool used for adjustment can be used to provide future patient-specific preoperative risk assessments. We conclude that the RA—EWMA performs similarly to the DGLM, is conceptually and computationally simpler by virtue of having fewer and simpler stages, and has an intuitive appeal to a wide variety of stakeholders.

The spatial clustering in democracy and transitions suggests that international factors play a prominent role in forging democracies as well as influencing their durability. We argue that democracy often comes about as a result of changes in the relative power of important actors and groups as well as their evaluations of particular institutions, both of which are often influenced by forces outside the country in question. The scope and extent of connections with other democratic countries in a region can strengthen support for democratic reform and help sustain institutions in transitional democracies. Results from a transition model demonstrate that international factors can exert a strong influence on the prospects for transitions to democracy, and the spatial clustering in democracy and transitions cannot adequately be explained by the hypothesized domestic social requisites of individual countries.

All the nourishment material could be accounted for by onshore movement resulting in 89 m3  $m^1$  of accretion within 15 months of placement. Application of the Dean's Equilibrium Beach Profile model, before, during and after disposal, indicated that before nourishment the beach-nearshore profiles exhibited a deficit of sediment throughout their length. After nourishment, the profiles adjusted towards the equilibrium profile predicted by the model.

In many situations this assumption may not be true. In this paper we propose an approach of modeling respondent heterogeneity that identifies abrupt changes in the distribution of response coefficients around a threshold specification. Our model differs from traditional threshold models by introducing the threshold effect to describe across-unit behavior as opposed to within-unit behavior. We illustrate our proposed Bayesian threshold model for survey data from a large national retail bank that examines the effects of service wait times on customer satisfaction. We find evidence of a threshold effect where long in-process wait times are associated with bank branches characterized by weak associations between service quality drivers and overall perceptions of service quality. Branches with wait times below the threshold are found to have much stronger associations.

Design—Randomised study of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria treated with perindopril or nifedipine for 12 months and monitored for one or three months after stopping treatment depending on whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. Patients were randomised separately according to whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. Setting—Diabetic clinics in three university teaching hospitals. Patients—50 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. In all, 43 completed the study: 30 were normotensive and 13 hypertensive; 19 had type I diabetes and 24 had type II diabetes. Interventions—For 12 months 20 patients were given perindopril 2-8 mg daily and 23 were given nifedipine 20-80 mg daily. Main outcome measures—Albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate. Results—Both perindopril and nifedipine significantly reduced mean blood pressure. During treatment there was no significant difference between those treated with perindopril and those treated with nifedipine with respect to albuminuria or mean blood pressure. Stopping treatment with both drugs was associated with a sustained increase in albuminuria and mean blood pressure. There was a significant correlation between mean blood pressure and albuminuria and also between the reduction in mean blood pressure and the decrease in albuminuria during treatment with both drugs. In hypertensive patients both drugs caused significant decreases in mean blood pressure and albuminuria. In normotensive patients there was no significant reduction in albuminuria with either regimen. Conclusions—In diabetic patients with microalbuminuria blood pressure seems to be an important determinant of urinary albumin excretion. Perindopril and nifedipine have similar effects on urinary albumin excretion, both prevention increases in albuminuria in normotensive patients and decreasing albuminuria in hypertensive patients.

Davies	New Phytologist	179	2	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 378-385	New Phytologist Trust, Wiley	fla		Calcium (Ca²⁺)-permeable plasma membrane ion channels are critical to root hair elongation and signalling. Arabidopsis thaliana root hair plasma membrane contains a hyperpolarization-activated Ca²⁺ channel (HACC) conductance. Here, the coresidence of HACC with a depolarization-activated Ca²⁺ channel (DACC) conductance has been investigated. Whole-cell patch-clamping of apical plasma membrane has been used to study Ca²⁺ conductances and reveal the negative slope conductance typical of DACCs. Specific voltage protocols, Ba²⁺-permeation and inhibition by the cation channel blocker Gd³⁺ have been used to identify the DACC conductance. The Gd³⁺ sensitive DACC conductance was identified in only a minority of cells. DACC activity was quickly masked by the development of the HACC conductance. However, in the period between the disappearance of the negative slope conductance and the predominance of HACC, DACC activity could still be detected. A DACC conductance coexists with HACC in the root hair apical plasma membrane and could provide Ca²⁺ influx over a wide voltage range, consistent with a role in signalling.

Cook, Mark R. Forbes	Invertebrate Biology	127	4	2008-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 417-425	American Microscopical Society, Wiley	fla		Intersexes are common in crustaceans. Typically, these intersexes are sterile or function as females, but prior evidence from laboratory experiments suggests that intersexes of a key species of gammaridean amphipod, Corophium volutator, might function as males. We observed that intersexes of C. volutator behaved as males by crawling (mate-searching) on a mudflat during ebb tides and pairing in burrows with female amphipods. In the laboratory, intersexes and males did not differ in aspects of crawling such as movement rate and measures of burrow investigation. Pntersexuality was costly in that intersexes crawled less often than males on a mudflat, formed fewer pairs with females than males, and remained in tandem less often with receptive females than males. The use of PCR-based identification methods failed to identify the presence of transovarial, feminizing, microsporidian parasites as a major cause of intersexuality in this species in that infected females did not produce broods that contained more intersexes than broods produced by uninfected females. Because intersexes may be mistaken as females, the percentage of functional males in amphipod populations may be underestimated: an important consideration given male limitation in populations of C. volutator. The occurrence of intersexes has significant implications for studies on the evolution and ecology of sex ratios, and the use of crustaceans as indicators of environmental quality.

Such herbivory could maintain the productivity of ecosystems and should not be curtailed. This contrasts with the traditional view whereby herbivory always reduces plant production. Two grasshoppers (Melanoplus sanguinipes and Ageneotettix deorum), considered pest species in Western US rangelands, are experimentally shown to enhance plant production under certain conditions and to diminish it under others. Plant production increased when grasshoppers' consumption increased nitrogen cycling, nitrogen being the limiting resource for plants at the study sites. This happened when grasshoppers consumed plant species with slowly decomposing litter, favoring plants whose litter decomposed rapidly, such that their store of nitrogen was more rapidly released to the soil. However, feeding preferences change between sites and with grasshopper species, creating a spatial mosaic in which grasshoppers can increase and decrease plant production. Because changes in plant species composition are the major reason for changes in nutrient cycling rate, plant communities are created that will persistently exhibit enhanced or diminished production. Therefore, grasshoppers cannot be generally viewed as detrimental to rangeland productivity and grasshopper control may need to be more judiciously applied.

Strauss, Guofu Zhou	The Review of Financial Studies	23	2	2010-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 821-862	Oxford University Press, The Society for Financial Studies	fla		Welch and Goyal (2008) find that numerous economic variables with in-sample predictive ability for the equity premium fail to deliver consistent out-of-sample forecasting gains relative to the historical average. Arguing that model uncertainty and instability seriously impair the forecasting ability of individual predictive regression models, we recommend combining individual forecasts. Combining delivers statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average consistently over time. We provide two empirical explanations for the benefits of forecast combination: (i) combining forecasts incorporates information from numerous economic variables while substantially reducing forecast volatility; (ii) combination forecasts are linked to the real economy.

The aggregation properties of amyloid β proteins can be strongly affected by single-point mutations at positions 22 and 23. The Dutch mutation involves a substitution at position 22 (E22Q) and leads to increased deposition rates of the AβE22Q peptide onto preseeded fibrils. We investigate the effect of the E22Q mutation on two key regions involved in the folding and aggregation of the Aβ peptide through replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the 15-28 fragment of the Aβ peptide. The Aβ15-28 peptide encompasses the 22-28 region that constitutes the most structured part of the Aβ peptide (the E22-K28 bend), as well as the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC) (segment 17-21), the primary docking site for Aβ monomers depositing onto fibrils. Our simulations show that the 22-28 bend is preserved in the Aβ(15-28) peptide and that the CHC, which is mostly unstructured, interacts with this bend region. The E22Q mutation does not affect the structure of the bend but weakens the interactions between the CHC and the bend. This leads to an increased population of β-structure in the CHC. Our analysis of the fibril elongation reaction reveals that the CHC adopts a β-strand conformation in the transition state ensemble, and that the E22Q mutation increases aggregation rates by lowering the barrier for Aβ monomer deposition onto a fibril. Thermodynamic signatures of this enhanced fibrillization process from our simulations are in good agreement with experimental observations.

We find that the announcement of these rules has a significant effect on firm value. Firms that are less compliant with the provisions of the rules earn positive abnormal returns compared to firms that are more compliant. We also find variation in the response across firm size. Large firms that are less compliant earn positive abnormal returns but small firms that are less compliant earn negative abnormal returns, suggesting that some provisions are detrimental to small firms.

Sell	Population Studies	31	1	1977-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 129-141	Population Investigation Committee, Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		This paper describes changes in the incidence of marital childlessness among United States women since 1940 and tests a model to explain recent observed trends toward increasing childlessness. Based on U.S. Bureau of the Census sources, data are presented that indicate a substantial increase in childlessness for married women under 30 years of age since 1960. A path model is developed based on previous research on childlessness, in an attempt to explain this change. The model is composed of 1960-70 changes in (1) mean age at first marriage, (2) mean educational attainment, (3) the proportion of women in the labour force, (4) the proportion of women enrolled as students, (5) the incidence of marital disruption, and (6) the proportion of women living in urban environments. Using quarter-year age cohort data derived from the 1960 and 1970 1/100 Public Use Samples the results indicate that a substantial part of the increase in childlessness can be explained by this model. Particularly important were increased enrolment of married women in education, labour force participation, and mean age of first marriage. The results suggest the relevance of structural changes along with birth expectation attitudes in predicting trends in childlessness in the United States.

Preservice and inservice art teacher assessment is one such impacted area. This paper examines implicit Holmes assumptions about knowledge and learning. The ways in which these assumptions are in conflict with certain stated purposes - accommodation of diverse populations and fostering critical thinking - is discussed. Further, the logical conclusion to which these assumptions lead (standardization and homogeneity) is discussed. Finally, the impact of these epistemological assumptions on conceptions of art knowledge, learning and teacher assessment are considered. It is suggested that art education could provide a needed evaluative counterpoint to current trends toward simplistic standardization.

McCann	American Journal of Political Science	41	2	1997-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 564-583	Midwest Political Science Association	fla		The recent scholarly literature on core political values has paid relatively little attention to how values change over time. Drawing on studies in social psychology that find that values are reformulated as individuals take on new identities and roles or process new political information, I argue that choosing sides during a major national election campaign provokes shifts in core political values. Furthermore, in keeping with Philip Converse's (1964) discussion of dynamic attitude constraint, value change following electoral mobilization is expected to lead to new positions regarding particular government policies. Backing Bill Clinton in 1992 led citizens to become more committed to egalitarianism and less attached to moral traditionalism; the reverse is hypothesized to have occurred for supporters of George Bush. In turn, changes in levels of egalitarianism caused shifts in support for federal social welfare spending; new positions on moral traditionalism led to changes regarding abortion policy. Maximum likelihood (LISREL) measurement and structural models are estimated using a CPS panel survey of the mass public in 1990 and 1992. As hypothesized, presidential preferences in 1992 led to changes in core value stands, even when measurement error and reciprocity between value positions and candidate choice were factored in. As the respondents' values changed, moreover, their positions on several concrete policy items were also significantly modified.

Moon, Alexa Tullis	Physiological and Biochemical Zoology	79	1	2006-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 20-30	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Abstract   High‐performance muscles such as the shaker muscles in the tails of western diamond‐backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) are excellent systems for studying the relationship between contractile performance and metabolic capacity. We observed that shaker muscle contraction frequency increases dramatically with growth in small individuals but then declines gradually in large individuals. We tested whether metabolic capacity changed with performance, using shaker muscle contraction frequency as an indicator of performance and maximal activities of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase as indicators of aerobic and anaerobic capacities, respectively. Contraction frequency increased 20‐fold in 20–100‐g individuals but then declined by approximately 30% in individuals approaching 1,000 g. Mass‐independent aerobic capacity was positively correlated with contractile performance, whereas mass‐independent anaerobic capacity was slightly but negatively correlated with performance; body mass was not correlated with performance. Rattle mass increased faster than the ability to generate force. Early in ontogeny, shaker muscle performance appears to be limited by aerobic capacity, but later performance becomes limited equally by aerobic capacity and the mechanical constraint of moving a larger mass without proportionally thicker muscles. This high‐performance muscle appears to shift during ontogeny from a metabolic constraint to combined metabolic and mechanical constraints.

The antibody was nonreactive with several strains of  $Kl^-$  E. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. All E. coli Kl clinical isolates tested were reactive with the antibody. When assayed for in vitro opsonophagocytic ability, the antibody caused bacterial removal only in the presence of human complement and neutrophils, an observation suggesting a nonbacteriolytic, neutrophil-dependent killing mechanism. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the antibody was highly protective for infectious disease when used prophylactically in three animal models. The data suggest a potential use for human monoclonal antibodies in preventing and/or treating infections of the blood.

Topological quantum computation proposes to use the topological protection and the braiding statistics of a non-Abelian topological state to perform quantum computation. The enormous technological prospect of topological quantum computation provides new motivation for experimentally observing a topological state. Here, we explicitly work out a realistic experimental scheme to create and braid the Abelian topological excitations in the Kitaev model built on a tunable robust system, a cold atom optical lattice. We also demonstrate how to detect the key feature of these excitations: their braiding statistics. Observation of this statistics would directly establish the existence of anyons, quantum particles that are neither fermions nor bosons. In addition to establishing topological matter, the experimental scheme we develop here can also be adapted to a non-Abelian topological state, supported by the same Kitaev model but in a different parameter regime, to eventually build topologically protected quantum gates.

Ostfeld	Journal of Mammalogy	71	4	1990-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 510-519	American Society of Mammalogists	fla		Sexual body-length dimorphism and relative size of testes were compared among 16 species (25 subspecies) of North American Microtus and Clethrionomys by use of data collected from museum specimens. Species with polygynous mating systems and territorial males had the greatest degree of sexual size dimorphism with males larger than females, and relatively small testes. Promiscuous species tended to show little or no sexual size dimorphism and relatively large testes. Species considered monogamous had no size dimorphism, and also had large testes. These data support the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in size is correlated with the intensity of intrasexual competition for mates. However, the hypothesis that species with single-male breeding systems (single-male polygyny and monogamy) have relatively smaller testes than species with mating systems characterized by a high potential for sperm competition (promiscuity) was supported only for polygynous species.

I test (1) whether changes in priest's beliefs and values are due to cultural trends (indicated by birth cohort) or institutional selection (indicated by ordination cohort); and (2) whether they are related to liberalism/conservatism generally or to specific conformity to Catholic moral positions. Data are from the 2002 Los Angeles Times priest survey (N = 1,854). Results are mixed: I find support for the thesis of institutional selection for conformity since 1969, but not before. Prior to the 1960s, clergy (and lay) Catholic dissent increased linearly by birth cohort; since 1969, institutional selection, not cultural change, accounts for declining clergy dissent (while lay dissent has continued to increase). Implications for understanding changes in the Catholic Church and for religious theory are discussed.

All occurred on rounded peaks or ridges, with south or southwest facing slopes, above 1150 m, in the transition zone between red spruce (Picea rubens) and northern hardwood forests. Mountain oat grass (Danthonia compressa) was the dominant herb, although other grasses were abundant. At two sites, forbs and ferns were codominant. Blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) were dominant in the shrub strata at all sites. Comparison of the vegetation of West Virginia sites to five grass balds studied by Gilbert (1954) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) revealed the following differences: (1) balds of the two regions shared some dominants, but West Virginia balds were more diverse in the herbaceous layer, with lower levels of dominance. (2) West Virginia balds also had a more highly developed shrub strata. Recent studies of Gilbert's GSMNP sites in 1958, 1964, and 1979 have revealed a significant shrub and tree invasion, and a decrease in dominance of grasses. These changes suggest that Gilbert's GSMNP balds are becoming more similar to the West Virginia sites.

Sargeant	The Journal of Wildlife Management	70	5	2006-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1372-1378	Wildlife Society, Wiley	fla		Counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) in northwestern Wyoming and adjacent Montana, USA, have decreased at an average rate of 6-8% per year since wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced in 1995. Population growth rates of elk are typically sensitive to variations in adult female survival; populations that are stable or increasing exhibit high adult female survival. We used survival records for 85 radiocollared adult female elk 1-19 years old to estimate annual survival from March 2000 to February 2004. Weighted average annual survival rates were approximately 0.83 (95% CI = 0.77-0.89) for females 1-15 years old and 0.80 (95% CI = 0.73-0.86) for all females. Our estimates were much lower than the rate of 0.99 observed during 1969-1975 when fewer elk were harvested by hunters, wolves were not present, and other predators were less numerous. Of 33 documented deaths included in our analysis, we attributed 11 to hunter harvest, 14 to predation (10 wolf, 2 unknown, 1 cougar [Puma concolor], and 1 bear [Ursus sp.]), 6 to unknown causes, and 2 to winter-kill. Most deaths occurred from December through March. Estimates of cause-specific annual mortality rates were 0.09 (0.05-0.14) for all predators, 0.08 (0.04-0.13) for hunting, and 0.07 (0.03-0.11) for wolves specifically. Wolf-killed elk were typically older (median = 12 yr) than hunter-killed elk (median = 9 yr, P = 0.03). However, elk that winter outside the park where they were exposed to hunting were also younger (median = 7 yr) than elk that we did not observe outside the park (median = 9 yr, P < 0.01). Consequently, differences in ages of elk killed by wolves and hunters may reflect characteristics of elk exposed to various causes of mortality, as well as differences in susceptibility. Unless survival rates of adult females increase, elk numbers are likely to continue declining. Hunter harvest is the only cause of mortality that is amenable to management at the present time.

At the high confidence levels at which bank loan portfolio and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) default losses are typically measured for economic capital and rating purposes, conventionally based loss estimates are downward biased by a full order of magnitude on test portfolios. Our estimates are based on U.S. public nonfinancial firms between 1979 and 2004. We find strong evidence for the presence of common latent factors, even when controlling for observable factors that provide the most accurate available model of firm-by-firm default probabilities.

If Y<sup>(p)</sup> is uniform, then X has a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix ∑. The use of classical spherical distributions or other nonuniform distributions for Y<sup>(p)</sup> leads to interesting, controllable departures from normality that are particularly relevant to robustness studies. Their use is illustrated in a Monte Carlo investigation of the robustness of Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup>. Variate generation routines for the cardioid, triangular, offset normal, wrapped normal, wrapped Cauchy, von Mises, power sine, Fisher, and Bingham distributions are developed.

Lindsay	Journal of Mammalogy	67	2	1986-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 317-325	American Society of Mammalogists	fla		Multivariate analysis of cranial characters of the tree squirrel, Tamiasciurus douglasii, was employed in an evaluation of geographic variation. Principal components analysis yielded a strong size component. Regression and correlation analyses identified conifer cone size, toughness, and caloric content as good predictors of variation in size of squirrels. A hypothesis that squirrel morphology is influenced by pressures associated with maintaining efficiency in conifer cone caching and winter cone utilization is examined. It suggests that with geographic changes in cone morphology, squirrel size has undergone selection. The smallest squirrels were found in spruce, hemlock, and redwood forests, where trees have small cones with little energy per cone. Larger squirrels were from forests with predominantely large, energy rich pine cones. It appears that populations of T. douglasii have developed feeding tactics based on morphology which minimize loss of net energy available from their primary winter food source by increasing their efficiency in handling time. Large squirrels utilize large cones that give a high net energy/handling time ratio in areas where food must be consumed quickly. Small squirrels utilize small, probably lower ratio cones in less demanding environments.

This study examined how teams should respond to these conflicts. Three types of conflict responses were studied: collaborating responses, contending responses, and avoiding responses. A field study involving a heterogeneous sample of teams performing complex, non-routine task showed that collaborating and contending responses to relationship conflict negatively relate to team functioning (i.e., voice, compliance, helping behavior) and overall team effectiveness, while avoiding responses were associated with high team functioning and effectiveness. It is suggested that collaborating and contending responses to relationship conflict distract team members from their tasks, while avoiding responses appear more functional in that they allow team members to pursue task performance.

In addition, the optimal allocation of sample elements among the treatment groups is explored through the evaluation of the expression for noncentrality under the comparative trial model. It is shown that a general rule for sample allocation, such as the "square root rule," does not apply uniformly. The non-central procedure is then compared to existing procedures for sample size determinations for 2 x 2 trials and it is shown that this procedure yields results in close agreement to those for the widely employed Halperin (twp-tailed) procedure. Finally, sample size determinations for other contingency table models are discussed.

Within the limitations imposed by the samples, the results lead to the tentative rejection of these hypotheses. Among blacks, the authority of mothers tends to be stronger in intact than in broken families. Furthermore, maternal authority in the household hand identification with a female role model do not appear to have the negative consequences on educational aspirations and school performance for black adolescent boys which have been attributed to them. Black mothers and their children have the same or higher educational aspirations than white regardless of the fact that the black adolescents tend to identify more closely with their mothers. The lower educational attainment of blacks must be sought in other factors within and outside the family which make it difficult for black adolescents to translate educational aspirations into educational achievement.

The singular importance of this quantity for decision-making purposes has initiated extensive research into percent proficient as a measure of school quality. In particular, technical discussions have scrutinized the impact of sampling, measurement, and other sources of error on percent proficient statistics. In this article, we challenge the received orthodoxy that measurement error associated with individual students' scores is inconsequential for aggregate percent proficient statistics. Synthesizing current classification accuracy research with techniques from randomized response designs, we establish results which specify the extent to which measurement error--manifest as performance level misclassifications--produces bias and increases error variability for percent at performance level statistics. The results have direct relevance for the design of coherent and fair accountability systems based upon assessment outcomes.

A major derivation from this theory is that attitude importance and extremity should be correlated, with more important attitudes being more extreme. This prediction was confirmed for 14 specific political issues at both the group and the individual level, as well as for political involvement and general liberalism. However, general political involvement was not related to the extremity of evaluation for specific issues; similarly, partisanship predicted extremity of general liberalism but not extremity on specific issues. Results suggest that attitude importance and extremity must be measured at corresponding levels of specificity in order for a relationship between them to hold. These results have implications for attitude change in both individuals and societies.

This article describes a methodology for representing mental models as maps, extracting these maps from texts, and analyzing and comparing these maps. The methodology employs a set of computer-based tools to analyze written and spoken texts. These tools support textual comparison both in terms of what concepts are present and in terms of what structures of information are present. The methodology supports both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the resulting representations. This approach is illustrated using data drawn from a larger study of students learning to write where it is possible to compare mental models of the students with those of the instructor.

Lumb, Paru B. Oatey, Patricia R. Jennings, Priyal A. De Zoysa, Ronald J. A. Wanders, Henk F. Tabak, Christopher J. Danpure	The Journal of Cell Biology	131	1	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 95-109	The Rockefeller University Press	fla		Alanine/glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT) is peroxisomal in most normal humans, but in some patients with the hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), AGT is mislocalized to the mitochondria. In an attempt to identify the sequences in AGT that mediate its targeting to peroxisomes, and to determine the mechanism by which AGT is mistargeted in PH1, we have studied the intracellular compartmentalization of various normal and mutant AGT polypeptides in normal human fibroblasts and cell lines with selective deficiencies of peroxisomal protein import, using immunofluorescence microscopy after intranuclear microinjection of AGT expression plasmids. The results show that AGT is imported into peroxisomes via the peroxisomal targeting sequence type 1 (PTS1) translocation pathway. Although the COOH-terminal KKL of human AGT was shown to be necessary for its peroxisomal import, this tripeptide was unable to direct the peroxisomal import of the bona fide peroxisomal protein firefly luciferase or the reporter protein bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. An ill-defined region immediately upstream of the COOH-terminal KKL was also found to be necessary for the peroxisomal import of AGT, but again this region was found to be insufficient to direct the peroxisomal import of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Substitution of the COOH-terminal KKL of human AGT by the COOH-terminal tripeptides found in the AGTs of other mammalian species (SQL, NKL), the prototypical PTS1 (SKL), or the glycosomal PTS1 (SSL) also allowed peroxisomal targeting, showing that the allowable PTS1 motif in AGT is considerably more degenerate than, or at least very different from, that acceptable in luciferase. AGT possessing the two amino acid substitutions responsible for its mistargeting in PH1 (i.e., Pro11→Leu and Gly170→Arg) was targeted mainly to the mitochondria. However, AGTs possessing each amino acid substitution on its own were targeted normally to the peroxisomes. This suggests that Gly170→Arg-mediated increased functional efficiency of the otherwise weak mitochondrial targeting sequence (generated by the Pro11→Leu polymorphism) is not due to interference with the peroxisomal targeting or import of AGT.

Krosnick	The Public Opinion Quarterly	73	4	2009-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 641-678	American Association for Public Opinion Research, Oxford University Press	fla		In a national field experiment, the same questionnaires were administered simultaneously by RDD telephone interviewing, by the Internet with a probability sample, and by the Internet with a nonprobability sample of people who volunteered to do surveys for money. The probability samples were more representative of the nation than the nonprobability sample in terms of demographics and electoral participation, even after weighting. The nonprobability sample was biased toward being highly engaged in and knowledgeable about the survey's topic (politics). The telephone data manifested more random measurement error, more survey satisficing, and more social desirability response bias than did the Internet data, and the probability Internet sample manifested more random error and satisficing than did the volunteer Internet sample. Practice at completing surveys increased reporting accuracy among the probability Internet sample, and deciding only to do surveys on topics of personal interest enhanced reporting accuracy in the nonprobability Internet sample. Thus, the nonprobability Internet method yielded the most accurate self-reports from the most biased sample, while the probability Internet sample manifested the optimal combination of sample composition accuracy and self-report accuracy. These results suggest that Internet data collection from a probability sample yields more accurate results than do telephone interviewing and Internet data collection from nonprobability samples.

Business diversification on farms is a literal step towards this direction. However, even the diversified businesses on farms are often in an underdog position within vertical networks. The business may be dependent on only one big client. Achieving personal control in the market arena, which is essential for entrepreneurial identity, is problematic in these kinds of situations. The article is based on interviews with 40 farm families engaged in business diversification in Finland. The analysis focuses on the presentation of personal control in the market arena. In one end, there were cases in which the farmer could take advantage of a wide set of marketing and customer related means of control. In the other end, there were cases in which these means of control were practically nonexistent to the farmer. The variation of personal control in the market arena was—to a great extent—contingent on the farmer's relation to vertical networks. II y a une pression croissante sur les fermiers pour qu'ils deviennent entrepreneurs. La diversification des affaires dans les fermes est littéralement un pas dans cette direction. Cependant, même les affaires diversifiées dans les fermes sont souvent dans dans une position défavorisée dans les réseaux verticaux. L'affaire peut ne dépendre que d'un ceul gros client. Acquérir une maîtrise personnelle dans l'arène des marchés, atout essentiel pour l'identité d'entrepreneur (entreprenariale), est problématique dans ce type de contextes. Cet article est basé sur des interviews auprès de 40 familles fermières engagées dans la diversification des affaires en Finlande. L'analyse s'est focalisée sur la présentation de la maîtrise personelle sur la scène des marchés. D'un côté, il y avait des cas où le fermier pouvait profiter d'un large éventail de moyens de contrôle liés au marketing et au client. De l'autre côté, il y avait des cas où lesdits moyens de contrôle étaient pratiquement inexistants pour le fermier. La variation de la maîtrise personnelle sur la scène des marches était -dans une large mesure-dépendante de la relation du fermier aux réseaux verticaux. Hay una presión creciente sobre los granjeros para que se conviertan en empresarios. La diversificación de negocios en las granjas es, literalmente, un paso en esa dirección. Sin embargo, inclusive los negocios que han sido diversificados en las granjas se encuentran a menudo en una posición desvalida dentro en las redes verticales. Los negocios pueden depender por completo de un solo gran cliente. Alcanzar el control personal en la arena del mercado, algo que es esencial para la identidad empresarial, es problemático en esta clase de situaciones. El artículo se basa en las entrevistas realizadas a 40 familias de granjeros implicadas en la diversificación de negocios en Finlandia. El análisis se enfoca en la presencia del control personal en la arena del mercado. En un extremo, hubo casos en los cuales el granjero pudo aprovechar una amplia variedad de medios de control relacionados con el mercadeo y con el consumidor. En el otro extremo, hubo casos en los cuales esos medios de control fueron prácticamente inexistentes para el granjero.

Ellen Netting	Journal of Social Work Education	44	3	2008-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 159-172	Council on Social Work Education	fla		Teaching policy analysis is compared to teaching research skills. Both involve the selection of an appropriate analytical tool to be used with multiple units of analysis; and in both, the selected instrument must fit the purpose of the analysis or the product is not useful. Policy analysis frameworks characteristically address policy process, content, and performance. However, these frameworks are based on different worldviews, with embedded assumptions and with deep philosophical roots that may be rational (classical), interpretive, or progressive (radical). These different assumptions can lead to very different analytical expectations and results. Here, we justify teaching policy analysis as research, categorize a number of frameworks, and provide recommendations for equipping students to critically assess issues that arise in the development and use of policy analysis frameworks.

We consider the place of the concept within the discipline of demography, and demonstrate how its definition and use interact with cultural values and core concepts integral to the discipline. Focusing on Tanzania as a case study, we examine the diversity of factors that influence the construction of household-level data from cross-sectional household surveys. Throughout the survey process, contrasting interpretations of the meaning of household and different motivations for using specific definitions of the term interact. This generates data and outputs with potential for undercounting, bias, and misrepresentations, with adverse effects on the quality of data used for monitoring development indicators. Some ways of improving data collection on households are proposed.

Adum, Mark-Oliver Rödel	Biotropica	45	1	2013-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 94-101	The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation	fla		Making generalizations about the impact of commercial selective logging on biodiversity has so far remained elusive. Species responses to logging depend on a number of factors, many of which have not been studied in detail. These factors may include the natural forest conditions (forest types) under which logging impacts are investigated; but this question has so far remained unexamined. In a large-scale replicate study we aimed at clarifying the relationship between logging and forest types on leaf litter frogs. We contrast three distinct and naturally occurring forest types, including wet evergreen, moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Selectively logged sites were compared with primary forest sites for each forest type. We found that the response of frog communities to logging varies in different forest types. In the wet evergreen forest, richness was higher in logged forest than primary forest, while diversity measures were not different between logged and primary forest habitats. In the moist evergreen, richness and diversity were higher in selectively logged areas compared with primary forest habitats. In the semi-deciduous, logged forests were characterized by drastic loss of forest specialists, reduced richness, and diversity. These results indicate that the net effect of logging varies with respect to forest type. Forest types that are characterized by adverse climatic conditions (i.e., low rainfall and protracted dry seasons) are more likely to produce negative effects on leaf litter anuran communities. For comparisons of the impact of logging on species to be effective, future research must endeavor to include details of forest type.

Using pooled time-series cross-section data on election results from 15 East European democracies, the empirical analysis finds that (1) right after a regime change electoral volatility increases while the trend is reversed after democracy has endured for about a decade; (2) ethnic cleavages have no effect on stability while social cleavages affect electoral stability only during economic downturns; (3) both institutions and economic performance influence the stability of party support; however, the effect of the latter diminishes over time when democracies mature.

(KKR) played the lead role in pursuing large-scale leveraged buyouts in the U.S. market for corporate control in the 1980s by taking advantage of investment opportunities created by three decades of public policies regarding antitrust, pensions, corporate governance, and banking. KKR's innovations were its ability to overcome investors' collective action and monitoring problems by arranging takeovers through limited partnerships and by managing acquired firms through shared equity ownership with management. These organizational innovations, when combined with the financial changes of the 1980s, allowed KKR and its investor-controlled associations to challenge managerially controlled firms.

The 50 and 99% lethal concentrations with confidence limits were calculated. Eggs of the species tested were more tolerant than larvae, which were destroyed by very brief exposures (less than 2 minutes) to residuals less than 0.1 mg/l. Because of the sensitivity of the larvae, residual ozone concentrations in natural waters should remain well below 50 μg/l.

(2) Faecally excreted ivermectin inhibited the development of larvae of dung-dwelling Diptera Cyclorrhapha in dung collected from cattle 0-30 days after treatment. Larvae of dung beetles (Aphodius spp.) were inhibited in dung from animals treated 1 day previously, and pupae and larvae of Diptera Nematocera were inhibited in dung from animals treated 1 and 1-10 days previously, respectively. Excreted ivermectin remained active against a laboratory strain of the housefly Musca domestica in dung pats exposed for 2 months in the field. (3) The decomposition of dung pats from recently treated heifers was delayed significantly when compared with untreated controls. No adverse effects of treatment were recorded on earthworms. Hence, the retarded decomposition rate was ascribed to the adverse effects on the primary dipteran decomposing fauna. (4) The consequences of treatment in terms of fouling of pastureland are discussed, and the need for further research on the implications of future routine use of continuous slow-release ivermectin treatments is emphasized.

Antibodies to chlamydial antigens were found in 32 of 34 persons with pneumonitis. Microimmunofluorescence antibody tests suggest that the etiologic agent is closely related or identical to TW-183, an unusual strain of Chlamydia psittaci isolated from the eye of a child in Taiwan. The point prevalence of pneumonitis with antibody to TW-183 in school children at the time of the survey was high - 15 and 19 patients per 1,000 students in the two communities. There was no evidence of avian transmission in the epidemic.

Veevers	Journal of Paleontology	33	5	1959-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 888-901	Paleontological Society, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology	fla		For brachiopods the only valid basis for reconstructing the size distribution of the original population before burial is a complete sample composed of all the fossil specimens in a given continuous volume of rock. Of the three samples analyzed, one represents a living population in which possibly two age-groups may be recognized, another represents an assemblage which originated by the removal of small valves from a living population by a water current of low competent velocity, while the third, a non-complete sample, gives inconclusive results. A critical comparison with Parkinson (1954) leads to the rejection of the part therein dealing with the comparison of means and variances. Higher degrees of linear correlation of characters in certain size-groups in the samples are probably related to the living position of the shell with respect to the pedicle. The change in shape at a width of approximately 21.5 mm. may be attributed to either environmental or genetic causes.

Nutman	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	197	9	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1333-1341	Oxford University Press	fla		Background. In areas where intestinal helminth infections are endemic, infections by these parasites may protect against skin test-measured reactivity to allergens, and it has been suggested that interleukin (IL)-10 may mediate this effect. This study investigated whether IL-10 and populations of IL-10⁺ T cells may modulate atopy in children living in an area where intestinal helminth infections are endemic. Methods. Ecuadorian schoolchildren from rural communities were assessed for skin test-measured reactivity to Periplaneta americana allergen and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen. Blood samples were collected from 39 skin test-positive and 41 skin test-negative children, and peripheral-blood leukocytes were cultured in the presence of Ascaris lumbricoides antigen, to measure IL-10 protein and the frequency of T cell populations expressing intracellular IL-10. We also investigated whether these immunological factors affected the association between allergen-specific IgE and skin test-measured reactivity to aeroallergens. Results. There was no evidence of association between the level of A. lumbricoides-induced IL-10 protein or IL-10⁺ T cells and skin test-measured reactivity to allergens. The association between allergen-specific IgE and skin test-measured reactivity was not affected by the level of IL-10 protein or the frequency of IL-10⁺ T cells. Conclusions. The results of this study do not support the notion that IL-10 plays a role in modulating atopy in children living in a tropical area where intestinal helminth infections are endemic.

Carver	Publius	19	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 161-174	Oxford University Press	fla		In principle, reporting by state and local governments to the federal government is essential to the design and implementation of national policy. In practice, reporting often engenders resentment of federal intrusion and is often dismissed as a waste of state and local resources. Is reporting useless? Does it strengthen the federal government at the expense of state and local governments? We asked federal, state, local, and site officials about the value and burden of five specific reporting systems in elementary and secondary education. Common assumptions about reporting did not correspond to respondent reactions. Both value and burden cascade through the intergovernmental system, reaching policymakers in all governments. Although critics seldom discriminate between types of reporting, we found that reporting designed to improve compliance with federal standards evoked different judgments of value and burden than reporting designed for assistance. These results suggest some new approaches to federal policy governing the collection of information and to the design of individual reporting systems.
