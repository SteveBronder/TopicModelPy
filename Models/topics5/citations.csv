Escobar,Journal of the American Statistical Association,81,393,1986-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 210-214,American Statistical Association,fla,,This article gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the simple linear unbiased estimator (SLUE) and the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the parameters when there are k independent sources of Type II censored data from a location scale distribution in which the location parameter is an unknown linear function of certain given independent variables and the scale parameter is an unknown constant. It also shows that the BLUE can be obtained in a two-stage procedure that has the same model-checking features and computational simplicity of the SLUE.

McNeil",Journal of the American Statistical Association,67,340,1972-12-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 743-749,American Statistical Association,fla,,"The schedule recording first marriage frequencies has been shown to take the same basic form in different populations, with differences only in the origin, area, and horizontal scale. It is shown here that a representative schedule is very closely approximated by a simple closed form frequency function, which is the limiting distribution of the convolution of an infinite number of exponentially distributed components. The schedule is approximated equally well by the convolution of a normal distribution (of age of entry into a marriageable state) and as few as three exponentially distributed delays. The latter convolution provides a plausible model of nuptiality, a model that receives surprising empirical support."

Several distributed lag models are examined in order to discover a possible delayed mortality response. The results of those models with geometrically declining lag coefficients are consistent with those of the other lag models. Adjustment is made for serial correlation, and the consequences of measurement error are explored. Application of the various models to four to six different time periods allows an examination of the consistency of these models. Results for all time periods indicate associations between daily mortality and air pollution values. The distributed lag models suggest that any lagged effect is negligible in comparison with the immediate response."

Here we consider a subclass of these processes in which the intensity is assumed to be a deterministic function of another nonexplosive marked point process. In particular, we will investigate an intensity jump process with an exponential decay having an analytic form for the distribution of the times and sizes of the jumps, which can be seen as a generalization of the classical shot noise process. Assuming that the intensity is unobservable, interest here is in its filtering, that is, in the computation of its conditional distribution, over a whole time interval, given an observed trajectory of realized events. Because, in general, this computation cannot be performed analytically, we propose a simulation method that provides an approximate solution, which relies on the reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Interestingly, the proposed filtering algorithm also allows the setup of a likelihood-based procedure for the estimation of the parameters of the model based on stochastic versions of the expectationnÌµmaximization (EM) algorithm. The potential of the filtering and estimation methods proposed are illustrated through some simulation experiments as well as on a financial ultra-high-frequency dataset of intraday S&amp;P500 futures prices."

Traditionally, the errors are assumed to be additive. In this article, I consider the case in which the error is multiplicative, a situation that arises when analyzing some recent data released by the U.S. Department of Energy. A consistent estimator  $\hat\beta$  is provided for regression coefficients Î² by correcting the asymptotic bias of the least squares estimate. It is shown that  $\hat\beta - \beta$ , after being normalized by an estimate of its covariance, is asymptotically normally distributed. This can, therefore, be used to construct approximate tests and confidence sets for Î². The results are essentially nonparametric."

This innovation conveys the novel insights that dynamic imagery can provide; yet, the imagery is developed from principles that make the representation useful when examined either statically or dynamically. This is because the development of the dynamic representation is guided by the same perceptual and technical principles used in making a motion picture. The particular implementation we describe is evaluated by a formal psychophysics experiment in which we measure the threshold correlation that can be perceived in our dynamic representation, and in each of three different types of graphical portrayals."

It is found that statistics of religious affiliation generally originate with the unstandardized records kept by clergymen or lay clerks in over 300,000 local churches, who are for the most part untrained. Officials of national religious bodies probably receive and publish reports from most local churches, but a considerable proportion of these officers make public official reports that are only their own estimates. Periodic compilations of ""the latest information"" are noted. A brief summary of the U.S. Censuses of Religious Bodies is also made. A Church Distribution Study is described. Social scientists probably regard most current statistics on religious affiliation as crude. The limitations and defects of these statistics have received relatively little documentary study by trained statisticians."

An estimation procedure is given as well as a statistical test of the hypothesis of symmetry versus the alternative of asymmetry. Asymmetric time series models are fit to several economic time series."

Under conditions generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if ""independent"" variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on ""micro"" and ""macro"" data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias. Finally, the estimation procedure and the ""micro-test"" for aggregation bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935-1954, for two firms."

Standard methods exist for when the data are normal, and simple methods have been developed for nonnormal data without covariates. The dynamic generalized linear model (DGLM) may be considered a standard for nonnormal data with covariates, but perhaps one that is overcomplicated for many contexts. We propose adapting the standard exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to take into account the effect of risk factors. By approximating the correct exponential family likelihood, we derive a risk-adjusted EWMA (RAâEWMA) that is essentially a standard EWMA applied to ""Pseudo-observations,"" which are the original observations adjusted for differential risk. The RAâEWMA can be expressed as a type of filter, in which current estimate = previous estimate + discounted predictive error. We review Bayesian state-space models related to the EWMA and examine the properties of each. The RAâEWMA and DGLM are compared algebraically, through simulation and an example. In the example, the expected mortality after surgery by a particular surgeon is allowed to vary over time and is estimated through the RAâEWMA. Each binary observation is adjusted for the effect of patient-specific risk factors to standardize information fed into the estimator for the expected mortality for a ""Baseline"" patient. The tool used for adjustment can be used to provide future patient-specific preoperative risk assessments. We conclude that the RAâEWMA performs similarly to the DGLM, is conceptually and computationally simpler by virtue of having fewer and simpler stages, and has an intuitive appeal to a wide variety of stakeholders."

The development of the technique essentially involves determining, by successive approximations, a function which serves as the test criterion. This function is given through terms in the cubes of the reciprocals of the degrees of freedom involved in the problem, thereby giving a deviation from the advertised significance level which is smaller (in magnitude) than the deviation provided by the Satterthwaite procedure. An expression approximating the power of the test is also developed."

Moore and Wallis also noted that the signs of the first differences in a time series will have a negative serial correlation if the time series is a purely random process (or if it is a particular kind of generalization of a purely random process). It is therefore necessary to modify the Moore-Wallis test when applying it to such time series in order to take into account this serial correlation. In the present article, a simple modified form of the Moore-Wallis test is suggested, which can be applied to such time series. Somewhat similar modifications are also suggested for testing the existence of correlation between some more general kinds of time series. The importance of taking into account the effects of trends in the time series and the effects of the serial correlations (between the signs of the first differences) is illustrated by means of two numerical examples. Finally, the study of the movements in three or more time series is briefly discussed."

To address the problems associated with comparing subjects by the ignorable assignment-an ""intention-to-treat analysis""-we make use of instrumental variables, which have long been used by economists in the context of regression models with constant treatment effects. We show that the instrumental variables (IV) estimand can be embedded within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and that under some simple and easily interpretable assumptions, the IV estimand is the average causal effect for a subgroup of units, the compliers. Without these assumptions, the IV estimand is simply the ratio of intention-to-treat causal estimands with no interpretation as an average causal effect. The advantages of embedding the IV approach in the RCM are that it clarifies the nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity of the results to deviations from key assumptions in a straightforward manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of veteran status in the Vietnam era on mortality, using the lottery number that assigned priority for the draft as an instrument, and we use our results to investigate the sensitivity of the conclusions to critical assumptions."

We reanalyze data from a previously conducted experiment using two logistic regression models with random subject effects nested within an experimental condition factor. The two models have alternative covariates based on the alternative measures of working memory load. We construct prior distributions based on our subjective knowledge gleaned from related experiments, providing details of the elicitation process. We examine sensitivity of our results to the effects of prior misspecification and case deletion. Asymptotic approximations are used throughout to facilitate computations.

The commission further concluded that O-rings do not seal properly at low temperatures. In this article, data from the 23 preaccident launches of the space shuttle is used to predict O-ring performance under the Challenger launch conditions and relate it to the catastrophic failure of the shuttle. Analyses via binomial and binary logistic regression show that there is strong statistical evidence of a temperature effect on incidents of O-ring thermal distress. In addition, a probabilistic risk assessment at 31â¬F, the temperature at which Challenger was launched, yields at least a 13% probability of catastrophic field-joint O-ring failure. Postponement to 60â¬F would have reduced the probability to at least 2%. To assess uncertainty in estimates and for any future prediction under the Challenger scenario, a postanalysis prior distribution of the probability of a catastrophic failure is derived. The mean and median for this distribution for 31â¬F are at least .16 and .13, and for 60â¬F they are at least .004 and .02, respectively. The analysis of this article demonstrates that statistical science can play an important role in the space-shuttle risk-management process."

Examples of random measures that have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter extension, the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process, finite dimensional Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure for fitting them. In this article we present two general types of Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler, referred to as a Polya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with a known Polya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure. The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We find that the blocked Gibbs avoids some of the limitations seen with the Polya urn approach and should be simpler for nonexperts to use."

We investigate asymptotic relative efficiencies of the estimators that ignore the within-cluster correlation structure either in nonparametric curve estimation or throughout. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of these estimators through simulations and illustrate it using a longitudinal CD4 cell count dataset.

Special attention is given to the case of logistic regression on binary data, with error rates measured by the proportion of misclassified cases.

Regression estimates require XÌ, the population mean. If such information is unavailable, then one can sometimes obtain a large preliminary sample of xi relatively cheaply and use this to obtain a good estimate, say xÌ', of XÌ. A smaller subsample can then be taken and the characteristic of interest, yi, measured. A regression estimator can then be used treating xÌ' as if it were XÌ. This is termed double sampling, or two-phase sampling. This article focuses on variance estimators for the regression estimator in the aforementioned context and their use in constructing confidence intervals. A design-based linearization variance estimator that makes more complete use of the sample data than the standard one is considered for two-phase sampling. A jackknife variance estimator and its linearized version are obtained and shown to be design consistent. A bootstrap variance estimator is also shown to be design consistent. Unconditional and conditional repeated sampling properties of these variance estimators are studied through simulation. It is shown that the linearization variance estimator displays superior unconditional properties, but the jackknife and its linearized version perform better conditionally."

Matchar",Journal of the American Statistical Association,98,462,2003-06-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 273-281,American Statistical Association,fla,,"It is common to assess disability of stroke patients using standardized scales, such as the Rankin Stroke Outcome Scale (RS) and the Barthel Index (BI). The RS, which was designed for applications to stroke, is based on assessing directly the global conditions of a patient. The BI, which was designed for more general applications, is based on a series of questions about the patient's ability to carry out 10 basic activities of daily living. Because both scales are commonly used, but few studies use both, translating between scales is important in gaining an overall understanding of the efficacy of alternative treatments, and in developing prognostic models that combine several datasets. The objective of our analysis is to provide a tool for translating between BI and RS. Specifically, we estimate the conditional probability distributions of each given the other. Subjects consisted of 459 individuals who sustained a stroke and who were recruited for the Kansas City Stroke Study from 1995 to 1998. We assessed patients with BI and RS measures 1, 3, and 6 months after stroke. In addition, we included data from the Framingham study, in the form of a table cross-classifying patients by RS and coarsely aggregated BI. Our statistical estimation approach is motivated by several goals: (a) overcoming the difficulty presented by the fact that our two sources report data at different resolutions; (b) smoothing the empirical counts to provide estimates of probabilities in regions of the table that are sparsely populated; (c) avoiding estimates that would conflict with medical knowledge about the relationship between the two measures; and (d) estimating the relationship between RS and BI at three months after the stroke, while borrowing strength from measurements made at 1 month and 6 months. We address these issues via a Bayesian analysis combining data augmentation and constrained semiparametric inference. Our results provide the basis for comparing and integrating the results of clinical trials using different disability measures, and integrating clinical trials results into a comprehensive decision model for the assessment of long-term implications and cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention and acute treatment interventions. In addition, our results indicate that the degree of agreement between the two measures is less strong than commonly reported, and emphasize the importance of trial designs that include multiple assessments of outcome."

Willmot,Journal of the American Statistical Association,83,402,1988-06-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 517-521,American Statistical Association,fla,,"The standard contagious distributions (see Douglas 1980) have been used in such varied fields as biology and automobile insurance, often to model various physical phenomena as well as provide a good fit to count data when other models are inadequate. Unfortunately, the parameterizations often used when working with these distributions normally lead to extremely high correlations of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE's). This tends to lead to mathematical complexities, and causes difficulty or even errors in their interpretation. Furthermore, numerical difficulties may arise when using numerical procedures to locate the estimates. Some of these difficulties were discussed by Douglas (1980, pp. 171, 204-205), who suggested that a reparameterization to reduce or even eliminate such correlation is desirable. If the MLE's are asymptotically uncorrelated, the parameterization is orthogonal. Philpot (1964) derived an orthogonal parameterization for the Neyman Type A distribution; Stein, Zucchini, and Juritz (1987) derived for the Poisson mixture by the inverse Gaussian distribution. Parameter orthogonality has several attractive features in the present context. Since there is no correlation asymptotically, the estimates (with their standard errors) provide a simpler summary of the data than in the absence of such orthogonality. The use of a parameterization where the MLEs are highly correlated can lead to a misleading analysis, or at best a more complicated analysis that would be necessary if an orthogonal parameterization had been used. To the extent that a high correlation exists, the parameters involved tend to measure similar quantities, and orthogonality separates information about the parameters from each other. This article gives an orthogonal parameterization for a large family of discrete distributions, including many of the contagious distributions, some Poisson mixtures, and some other generalized distributions. The previously cited works are unified and extended, for example, to the Polya-Aeppli, Poisson-binomial, and Sichel's Poisson-generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. One of the orthogonal parameters is the mean, and in many applications it is of interest to express the mean as a function of relevant covariate information. For example, Hinde (1982) considered some of these distributions in a regression context. This article shows how the results may be extended to deal with the covariate case in a relatively straightforward manner. Consequently, a convenient parameterization exists for a large family of distributions in a wide variety of situations. Some numerical examples are given, and a simple algorithm is given to find the maximum likelihood estimates in the case of no covariates."

These age-specific rates are then compared with those observed, and an adjustment made for the next iteration. At most three iterations are sufficient to reproduce the observations to six places of decimals."

Instead of maximizing the joint posterior density, conditional upon the parameter of interest, a device described by O'Hagan is used first. The Bayesian estimators are compared to the Lindley-Stein shrinkage estimators and the Lindley-Smith joint modal estimators. It is confirmed that joint modes can overcollapse toward prior hypotheses, when compared with more sensible Bayesian procedures. This is referred to as a ""collapsing phenomenon."" A numerical example from the one-way random-effects model is considered, and the risks of the different estimators are simulated under a variety of loss functions. It is concluded that although the Lindley-Stein estimator performs well, a full hierarchical Bayesian analysis performs at least equally well, while permitting more detailed finite-sample inference regarding any parameter of interest."

This prescription avoids the need to directly specify prior probabilities of models and prior densities for the parameters. Instead, a prior prediction for the response induces the required priors. We propose normal and conjugate priors for generalized linear models, each using a single prior prediction for the mean response to induce suitable priors for each variable-subset model. In this way, an informative prior is used to select a subset of variables. In addition to producing a ranking of models by size of the predictive criterion, the standard deviation of the criterion is used as a calibration number to produce a set of equally good models. A straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to accomplish the necessary computations. We illustrate this method with real and simulated datasets and compare results with the Bayes factors and the Akaike information and Bayes information model selection criteria. The simulation results confirm the efficacy of the method, because the correct model is known. An illustrative application demonstrates selection of important predictors of success in identifying the sentinel lymph node during surgical treatment of breast cancer. A forward selection procedure is described to avoid a full search over the 2<sup>18</sup> possible models in this case."

Estimators for the spectral densities are derived from prior data using an extension to time series of the usual one-way analysis of variance. These estimators are inserted into approximations for the classical Bayes estimators to obtain empirical Bayes estimators.

Typically estimated by the maximum likelihood method, estimates are very sensitive to deviations from a model, such as heteroscedasticity and data contamination. At the same time, the traditional robust (high-breakdown point) methods, such as the maximum trimmed likelihood, are not applicable because, by trimming observations, they induce nonidentification of parameter estimates. To provide a robust estimation method for binary-choice regression, we consider a maximum symmetrically trimmed likelihood estimator (MSTLE) and design a parameter-free adaptive procedure for choosing the amount of trimming. The proposed adaptive MSTLE preserves the robust properties of the original MSTLE, significantly improves the finite-sample behavior of MSTLE, and also ensures the asymptotic equivalence of the MSTLE and maximum likelihood estimator under no contamination. The results concerning the trimming identification, robust properties, and asymptotic distribution of the proposed method are accompanied by simulation experiments and an application documenting the finite-sample behavior of some existing and the proposed methods."

For those regressors that are in common in the regressions, we consider using an Ising prior to smooth spatially the indicator variables representing whether or not the variable is zero or nonzero in each regression. This smooths spatially the probabilities that each independent variable is nonzero in each regression and indirectly smooths spatially the regression coefficients. We discuss how single-site sampling schemes can be used to evaluate the joint posterior distribution. The approach is applied to the problem of functional magnetic resonance imaging in medical statistics, where massive datasets arise that require prompt processing. Here the Ising prior with a three-dimensional neighborhood structure is used to smooth spatially activation maps from regression models of blood oxygenation. The Ising prior also has the advantage of allowing incorporation of anatomic prior information through the external field. Using a visual experiment, we show how a single-site sampling scheme can provide rapid evaluation of the posterior activation maps and activation amplitudes. The approach is shown to result in maps that are superior to those produced by a recent Bayesian approach using a continuous Markov random field for the activation amplitude."

In contrast to other specification tests for this model, the generalized moments test is applicable in the presence of continuous explanatory variables and does not require assigning the data to predetermined cells. The results of a Monte Carlo investigation suggest that the generalized moments test has good finite-sample properties and that it is more powerful than other available tests for models with continuous explanatory variables when the alternative is an accelerated failure time model. The test is based on generalized residuals for the proportional hazards model. When the model is correct, the generalized residuals have asymptotically the (possibly censored) unit exponential distribution. The generalized moments are means of functions of the generalized residuals. The generalized moments have known values when the generalized residuals have the unit exponential distribution, and an asymptotic Ï2 statistic tests for whether the differences between sample analogs of the generalized moments and the known values are larger than can be explained by random sampling errors."

Causal questions regarding dose effects are of interest, but one often wants to avoid the assumption that compliance quantiles on both randomized arms are comparable. Structural mean models (SMMs) do avoid this assumption; however, they do not allow for interaction effects between variables observed on different randomized arms. Such an interaction between observed exposure on the treatment arm and latent treatment-free response (i.e., placebo response) was suggested by the data. Building on structural models, we propose an approach that makes this possible. To allow for a structural interaction effect with potential placebo response, we invoke a compliance selection model. It turns out that SMMs imply identifiable selection models; hence the secondary model is testable. Next, to assess the amount of variation explained by the structural model, we identify separate variance components for different error types. This yields a measure of the variation in treatment effects over individuals. In addition, it allows us to compare the fit of different plausible structural models. On the BP data, we find a significant interaction effect: Higher exposure levels are estimated to have more effect in subgroups with poorer placebo response. Finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators are verified through simulation."

The correlation is modeled by the beta-binomial distribution. The three objectives of the study were to determine (a) the variances, biases, and relative efficiencies of the beta-binomial maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the binomial MLE, and the Mantel-Haenszel estimator of the common odds ratio; (b) the variances and biases of two estimators of the intracluster correlation coefficient, Ï; and (c) the effectiveness of adjusting variance estimates of the binomial and Mantel-Haenszel estimators using the two estimators of Ï. The simulation shows that increasing the size of the intracluster correlation coefficient increases the variance and the positive bias of all three estimators of the odds ratio. The Mantel-Haenszel estimator displays less variance and bias than the MLE except for large values of Ï and Ï. An unexpected but important observation, however, is that applying a cluster-inflation factor to the formula for the large-sample variance of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator often results in an overestimate of the variance. The only circumstances in which the unadjusted variance is an underestimate of the observed variance occur when the clustering is high and the odds ratio is unity or when the contingency tables represent a wide band of success probabilities. This observation, coupled with the fact that the Mantel-Haenszel estimator is expressed as a closed formula, leads to the recommendation of the large-sample variance formula as a conservative estimator in most cases. A comparison of the moment and analysis of variance (ANOVA) estimators of intracluster correlation coefficient Ï shows that the ANOVA estimator is consistently positively biased, but that both its bias and variance are less than those of the moment estimator, especially when Ï is small. The moment estimator is extremely positively biased when the correlation is low, and negatively biased when it is high."

However, recent research suggests that human exposure to the constituents of PM2.5 may differ significantly from ambient (or outdoor) PM2.5 concentration measured by monitors because people spend a great deal of time in environments, such as various indoor environments, where they are partially shielded from ambient sources of PM and are exposed to nonambient sources of PM. Recent research has provided some ways to include exposure information, but little has been done to determine the impact of including such information in a statistical model. To address this concern, we develop a three-stage Bayesian hierarchical model based on the Poisson regression model that is traditionally used to characterize the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and health endpoints. Our approach includes a spatial model relating monitor readings to average county PM2.5 concentration and an exposure simulator that links average ambient PM2.5 concentration to average personal exposure using activity pattern data. We apply our model to a study population in North Carolina and explore the impact of various exposure modeling assumptions on the conclusions that can be drawn about the link between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular mortality."

In this article, we analyze this model with an eye towards applying it to situations in which nonparametric statistics such as Kendall's tau, the Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon U, the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic, the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, and Friedman's statistic for randomized blocks designs are often used. The data for the basic model are a pair of vectors of length n, where both are permutations of the first n integers or one is a fixed and arbitrary design vector and the other a permutation. The model is Mallow's Ï model, a one-parameter exponential family with natural statistic the number of discordant pairs between the two vectors. This model originated with Mann and has appeared in many articles since. We extend the model to cases in which there may be ties in the observations and to analysis of variance problems (in which there are several parameters). The first four sections describe the models and verify the asymptotic normality of the statistics and the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters, as well as the asymptotic chi-squared nature of the likelihood ratio statistics under the null hypotheses. In Section 5 we compare the model to some other typical models. Section 6 contains examples, including analysis of the 1970 Draft Lottery data, and a 2 Ã 2 Ã 2 analysis of variance design."

The use of lead-reliability functions requires rules for identifying true and false peaks. In applying these rules, it was shown that the estimated values of the lead-reliability relationship are sensitive to the rule which is used to identify the true turns. A comparison of the predictive performance of the three techniques shows that both the diffusion index and the independent components are better predictors than the regression."

The LTD estimator has a 50% breakdown point and Gaussian efficiency of 66%-substantially higher than other common high-breakdown estimators such as least median of squares and least trimmed squares. The LTD estimator is difficult to compute, but can be performed using a ""feasible solution"" algorithm. Half-sample jackknifing is effective in producing standard errors.

Assuming independent sampling, optimal sample size allocations are obtained. Where these allocations require recourse to programming algorithms, approximate solutions are given. If independent sampling is not feasible, a double sampling procedure is suggested. To indicate how sub-sampling from the first phase sample is to be carried out, a sampling rule (possessing optimal conditional precision properties) is derived. Then, a procedure to determine the optimal first phase sample size is given. Finally, it is demonstrated that this double sampling procedure can be applied to estimation of the (finite) population mean when double sampling with stratification is used."

Extensions are made to several populations as well as to blocks of uniform covariance matrices. A special case, which is typical of the test procedures given here, is the problem of testing whether the mean vector of a bivariate normal distribution is equal to some specified vector based on n observations. The uniform structure assumes that the two unknown variances are equal though the correlation is arbitrary. The testing procedure leads to a statistic U which is distributed as the sum of two independent F<sub>1,n-1</sub> ratios which may be contrasted with the T<sup>2</sup> statistic proportional to F<sub>2, n-2</sub> used in the situation where the variances are not assumed equal."

A customer's signature for buying behavior, for example, may contain information on the likely place of purchase, value of goods purchased, type of goods purchased, and timing of purchases. The signature may be updated whenever the customer makes a transaction, and, because of storage limitations, the updating may be able to use only the new transaction and the summarized information in the customer's current signature. Standard sequential updating schemes, such as exponentially weighted moving averaging, can be used to update a characteristic that is observed at random, but timing variables like day of the week are not observed at random, and standard sequential estimates of their distributions can be badly biased. This article derives a fast, space-efficient sequential estimator for timing distributions that is based on a Poisson model that has periodic rates that may evolve over time. The sequential estimator is a variant of an exponentially weighted moving average. It approximates the posterior mean under a dynamic Poisson timing model and has good asymptotic properties. Simulations show that it also has good finite sample properties. A telecommunications application to a random sample of 2,000 customers shows that the model assumptions are adequate and that the sequential estimator can be useful in practice."

Statistical analyses and, in particular, random-walk models play a central role in inferring structural information from crystallographic data. Such methods are routinely employed by crystallographers in the determination of crystal symmetry from the experimental data, and in the solution of the outstandingly important problem for this discipline, the phase problem. Three classes of approaches are discussed: (a) methods based entirely on the central limit theorem; (b) approximate expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials that have the central-limit-theorem pdf as their weight function--that is, Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth expansions; and (c) pdf's that are exactly formulated and reduced to computable forms, represented as Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series. Both univariate and multivariate pdf's of crystallographic interest are derived and discussed. Some other approximate probabilistic approaches that have been applied to crystallographic problems are also briefly reviewed."

Logistic regression is generalized to the case of a betabinomial, hierarchical model, in which covariate information is included in the hyperparameters of the second-stage beta distribution. It is found that the posterior mean of the proportion discharged to SNF is approximately a weighted average (i.e., shrinkage estimator) of the logistic regression estimator and the observed rate. We develop fully Bayesian inference that takes into account uncertainty about the hyperparameters, and we find that this also allows us to test for overdispersion in a natural way. The number of observed zeros (i.e., hospitals that sent no stroke patients to a SNF) is excessive compared to the number expected from a standard logistic regression model and is fit better by the hierarchical betabinomial model. The factors associated with discharge to SNF differ between California and Florida. In California the case-matrix index and percent Medicaid admissions of the hospital, as well as the per capita income for the area and whether there is a rehabilitation facility in the area, are associated with discharge rates to SNF's. In Florida, whether there is a rehabilitation facility in the area is the only factor that exhibits association with discharge rates to SNF's."

We consider a dataset involving 542 goldenrod plants that has been analyzed in a limited fashion by others. Important extensions that we provide include nonparametric modeling of the size relationship, introduction of covariate information, incorporation of heterogeneity across plant families, and inclusion of measurement error models for both response and explanatory variables. Our approach is through hierarchical models taking advantage of available prior information on the magnitudes of the size variables. Models are fitted using simulation methods enabling a full range of inference. An attractive model choice criterion demonstrates the need to accommodate all of the aforementioned aspects for the given dataset. Our flexible modeling approach can be adapted to investigate other biological size relationships."

The approach can apply readily to many other statistical contexts. Various new penalty functions are proposed. The hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding estimators of Donoho and Johnstone are specific members of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators. They correspond to the lower and upper envelopes of a class of the penalized least squares estimators. Necessary conditions for penalty functions are given for regularized estimators to possess thresholding properties. Oracle inequalities and universal thresholding parameters are obtained for a large class of penalty functions. The sampling properties of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators are established and are shown to be adaptively minimax. To efficiently solve penalized least squares problems, nonlinear regularized Sobolev interpolators (NRSI) are proposed as initial estimators, which are shown to have good sampling properties. The NRSI is further ameliorated by regularized one-step estimators, which are the one-step estimators of the penalized least squares problems using the NRSI as initial estimators. The graduated nonconvexity algorithm is also introduced to handle penalized least squares problems. The newly introduced approaches are illustrated by a few numerical examples."

Transition matrices were calculated for all those who moved from a low to a non-low earnings category (and vice versa) sometime during 1957-1966. These matrices were non-stationary. It was hypothesized that changes in the level of economic activity were the primary cause of non-stationarity. Regression analysis results were consistent with this hypothesis. Increased growth was more beneficial for male non-white movers than for whites. A significant proportion of individuals stayed in a low earnings category for the entire period. The proportion of non-white males that did so was significantly greater than the corresponding white proportion.

(Here n denotes sample size.) Within the class of asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed estimators of a given parameter it is sometimes possible to demonstrate that one estimator possesses a smaller asymptotic variance than another, or that one estimator possesses the smallest asymptotic variance within a particular subclass. Asymptotic theory obviously does not predict anything about finite sample distribution functions Fn(x), Gn(x) â¯. In particular we cannot deduce from asymptotic theorems that the estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance will continue to exhibit the smallest dispersion in finite samples. Consequently it remains an essential task in positive estimation theory to derive the exact finite sample distribution functions of the alternative estimators that appear to be promising on the basis of asymptotic considerations. In econometric statistics the alternative estimators of structural coefficients in systems of simultaneous equations appear to possess rather complicated finite sample distribution functions. Monte Carlo experiments are resorted to for the purpose of providing useful leads in mathematical research into the nature of these distributions. In this article are presented some leading results of a mathematical investigation of the exact finite sample distribution functions of generalized classical linear estimators. The results presented here exhibit some particularly important implications for the conduct and evaluation of Monte Carlo experiments in econometric statistics."

There is much difficulty in the analysis of binary data with substantial nonresponse. We consider three Bayesian hierarchical models for binary nonresponse data, like those from the NCS, which are clustered within a number of domains or areas. As in small area estimation, one key feature is that each model ""borrows strength"" across the areas through the selection approach to nonresponse. This is necessary to estimate the parameters with the least association to the observed data (i.e., weakly identified parameters). The first model assumes that the nonresponse mechanism is ignorable, and the second model assumes that it is nonignorable. We argue that a discrete model expansion (a probabilistic mixture) may be inappropriate for modeling uncertainty about ignorability. Therefore, we propose a third model through a continuous model expansion on an odds ratio for each area. When the odds ratio is 1, we have the ignorable model; otherwise, the model is nonignorable. One important feature is that uncertainty about ignorability is incorporated by ""centering"" on the ignorable model. We analyze the poststratified data from the NCS to reveal latent features associated with nonresponse. The complexity of the posterior distributions of the parameters forces us to implement the methodology using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. When the proportion of households with a characteristic (i.e., victimization in the NCS) and the response probability of a household in the population are estimated, we find that the nonignorable model and the expansion model are similar but that they differ from the ignorable model. Although considerable prior information about the nonresponse mechanism is needed, the expansion model indicates that nonresponse for most of the areas is nonignorable. An analysis shows that inference is not very sensitive to an important distribution assumption, and a simulation exercise shows that the expansion model works very well."

Barnett,Journal of the American Statistical Association,61,316,1966-12-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 1205-1218,American Statistical Association,fla,,"In a recent paper in this Journal, Rothenberg, Fisher and Tilanus [1] discuss a class of estimators of the location parameter of the Cauchy distribution, taking the form of the arithmetic average of a central subset of the sample order statistics. They show that the average of roughly the middle quarter of the ordered sample has minimum asymptotic variance within this class, and that asymptotically it eliminates about 36 per cent of the efficiency loss of the median (the most commonly used estimator) in comparison to the maximum likelihood estimator (m.l.e.). Of course both the m.l.e. and the best linear unbiased estimator based on the order statistics (BLUE) achieve full asymptotic efficiency in the Cramer-Rao sense and there can be no dispute about the relative merits of the three estimators asymptotically, or about the inferiority of the median (with asymptotic efficiency <tex-math>$8/\pi^2 \doteqdot 0.8$</tex-math> compared with about 0.88 for the estimator of Rothenberg et al.). In any practical situation however, we will be concerned with estimation from samples of finite size and asymptotic properties will not necessarily give any guidance here. We are essentially concerned with two points in assessing the relative merits of estimators in small samples, their ease of application and ""small-sample efficiency"" which is conveniently measured as the ratio of the Cramer-Rao lower bound to the variance of the estimator. In this paper various estimators of the location of the Cauchy distribution are compared in these two respects for samples of up to 20 observations. The small-sample properties of the m.l.e. have been extensively discussed elsewhere (Barnett [2]) and relevant results are summarized where necessary. The main purpose of the paper is to discuss general linear estimators based on the order statistics, and to assess their utility in the present context. Since this paper was prepared a further interesting `quick estimator', based on order statistics, for the location of the Cauchy distribution has been suggested by Bloch [8]."

It is based on the top k order statistics and is a generalization of the Shapiro-Wilk goodness-of-fit statistic. The critical region of the test and its power against the alternative that the sample comes from a distribution in another domain of attraction are studied theoretically and by simulation. The power turns out to be superior to that of other tests previously proposed.

Platt, Dianne Gallagher",Journal of the American Statistical Association,84,408,1989-12-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 972-979,American Statistical Association,fla,,"Longitudinal studies often involve the repeated diagnosis across time of each patient's status with respect to a progressive categorical process. When the occurrence of a change in status is not readily apparent, two factors can make modeling and assessing the incidence rates of progression difficult. First, because diagnoses may be difficult, they may not be performed with the frequency necessary to pinpoint exact times of incidence. Second, uncertainty in the diagnostic process can obscure identification of the time interval in which incidence occurs. When serial diagnoses are fallible, even small error rates can seriously disrupt interpretation and make using the aforementioned methods difficult or impossible. For example, if false diagnoses (both false positives and negatives) occur independently with probability .05 in a longitudinal study involving four serial diagnoses, 19% of the strings of serial diagnoses would be expected to contain at least one error. If the underlying process is progressive, many of these errors would be noticeable: At face value, some patterns of diagnoses would describe regressions. Errors yielding patterns of diagnoses that are progressive would not be detectable. Simply omitting any subjects with inconsistent patterns from the analysis introduces bias. Another possible approach, using the first reported incidence of progression, also introduces bias (Schlesselman 1977). To analyze clinical data on the diagnosis of sexual maturation among subjects with sickle-cell disease, models are developed for jointly parameterizing incidence and error rates. An EM algorithm is presented that allows tractable maximum likelihood estimation even when the times of diagnoses are irregular and vary among subjects. Likelihood ratio tests are used to assess relationships between categorical covariates and both incidence and error rates. Data from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease are analyzed to describe the age distribution for the onset of puberty (according to the Tanner stage index) among homozygous (SS) males. Clear delays in maturation are apparent among SS males. Diagnostic error rates for Tanner staging appear to vary with the subject's age. False-positive diagnoses appear to be more common than false-negative diagnoses."

Calculations herein presented indicate that the county is not a very efficient primary sampling unit for state estimates.

The goal is to impute the missing data in the presence of edges or boundaries and recover the image. Two methods based on Bayesian hierarchical models that iterate between edge detection and spatial smoothing to impute the missing data within identified homogeneous regions are examined. Their performance is compared with another method that imputes the missing values using edge-preserving spatial smoothers with locally varying weights. The performances of the three methods are compared on artificial and real datasets. It is seen that information from the multivariate data is critical in recovering the images. An application with color images where only one of three primary colors (red, green, or blue) is observed at each pixel is used to illustrate the results."

To achieve this goal, we provide a general, formal framework for adaptively extending a group sequential trial to stop at any interim analysis time, often after a significance boundary for a clinical endpoint is crossed. For statistical inference, we propose to order the sample space by a class of well-ordered group sequential tests. On this basis, we develop a unified sequential statistical inference approach that is applicable to both interim monitoring and final analysis. We also show that the new ordering provides the foundation for the repeated confidence intervals procedure of Jennison and Turnbull."

On the other hand, when the parametric model does not hold, the true density f(x) may be estimated nonparametrically, as in the case of a kernel estimate fÌ(x). The key idea proposed is to fit a combination of the parametric and nonparametric estimates, namely, g(x, Ï) = Ï f(x, Î¸Ì) + (1 - Ï)fÌ(x), where Ï(0 â¤ Ï â¤ 1) is unknown. The parameter Ï is estimated from the data, and its estimate ÏÌ is then used in g(x, ÏÌ) as the proposed density estimate. The main point is that we expect ÏÌ) to be close to unity when the parametric model prevails, and close to zero when it does not hold. We show that, under certain conditions, g(x, ÏÌ) converges to the parametric density when the parametric model holds and approaches the true f(x) when the parametric model does not hold. The procedure was applied to a number of actual data sets. In each case the maximum likelihood estimate ÏÌ was readily obtained and the semiparametric density estimate provided a better understanding of which model prevailed. Other compromise estimates may also be used. One such is the geometric mean of cumulative distribution functions: H(x, Ï) = F<sup>Ï</sup>(x, Î¸Ì)FÌ<sup>1 - Ï</sup>(x), where F(x, Î¸Ì) is a parametric estimate of the parametric distribution function F(x, Î¸) and FÌ(x) is a nonparametric estimate of F(x)."

The methods are compared using both analytic and Monte Carlo results concerning coverages of the resulting intervals for the population mean. Using m = 2 imputations per missing value gives accurate coverages in common cases and is clearly superior to single imputation (m = 1) in all cases. The performances of the methods for various m can be predicted well by linear interpolation in 1/(m - 1) between the results for m = 2 and m = â. As a rough guide, to assure coverages of interval estimates within 2% of the nomial level when using the preferred methods, the number of imputations per missing value should increase from 2 to 3 as the nonresponse rate increases from 10% to 60%."

Single-linkage clustering is evaluated for consistency in detecting such high-density clusters-other standard hierarchical techniques, such as average and complete linkage, are hopelessly inconsistent for these clusters. The asymptotic consistency of single linkage closely depends on the percolation problem of Broadbent and Hammersley-if small spheres are removed at random from a solid, at which density of spheres will water begin to flow through the solid? If there is a single critical density such that no flow takes place below a certain density, and flow occurs through a single connected set above that density, then single linkage is consistent in separating high-density clusters (by disjoint single-linkage clusters that include a positive fraction of sample points in the respective clusters and pass arbitrarily close to all points in the respective clusters). The existence of a single critical point remains a conjecture. A weaker result is proved that shows that single-linkage clusters detect high-density clusters if there is a low enough valley separating them."

Through the analysis of differences and connections, we consolidate these methods into a generic algorithm by combining desirable features.

We estimate parameters of the models from past data, derive statistical intervals for the forecasts, and compare them with the official high-low intervals. We use the models to evaluate the forecasts rather than to develop different predictions of the future. Analysis of data from 1972 to 1985 shows that the official intervals for mortality forecasts for males or females aged 45-70 have approximately a 95% chance of including the true mortality rate in any year. For other ages the chances are much less than 95%. The Office of the Actuary's interval estimates of age- and cause-specific mortality for males and females have no consistent probabilistic interpretation. The ranges are too large for some diseases and too small for others."

A continuing problem is the identification of procedures which lead to better balance in such information.

A Bayesian analysis of such data based on proportional intensity model of multiple event time data is presented in this paper. The Bayesian structure is somewhat analogous to that used by Kalbfleisch in a proportional hazard model. An unobserved random frailty component is used in the proportional intensity model to take care of heterogeneity among the intensity processes in different subjects. The Monte Carlo method of sampling from multivariate distributions, the so-called Gibbs sampler, is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameters. The methodology developed here is exemplified with the well-known data set on rat tumors of Gail, Santner, and Brown."

If the averages arise from a multivariate normal sample, the procedure yields the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. It is shown that providing the number of vector observations is greater than the number of averages being combined, exact confidence intervals can be obtained based either on Student's ""t"" distribution or a related distribution (unfortunately not tabulated). If the averages arise from unequal sized samples on independent normal distributions with unequal variances, similar results hold subsequent to random matching and data transformation providing the minimum sample size is greater than the number of averages being combined. In both cases, the proposed estimate is almost linearly optimum in the sense that it has variance equal to that of the minimum variance linear unbiased estimate of the parameter except for a multiplicative factor which approaches unity as all sample sizes become large."

The distribution of the LR test in partially nonstationary models is nonstandard and contains nuisance parameters in the presence of non-iid errors and misspecified lags. In contrast, I show that under less-restrictive assumptions on the errors, the fully modified (FM) vector autoregressive (VAR) rank test has a chi-squared distribution for the null of cointegration but is degenerate for the null of no cointegration, unlike its LR counterpart, which is well defined for both nulls. It turns out that augmenting the VAR by an exogenous I(0) variable solves the degeneracy problem. The procedure can also be applied to testing for Granger causality and is in fact a generalization of Toda-Yamamoto's procedure of augmenting the VAR with additional lagged I(1) variables. Unlike the LR test for ranks or Toda-Yamamoto's test for causality, the FM tests do not require correct specification of the number of lagged variables in the VAR nor does it require that errors be iid."

This article presents some new identities relating the mean dimension, and some analogously defined higher moments, to the variance importance measures of I. M. Sobol. As a result, we are able to measure the mean dimension of certain functions arising in computational finance. We produce an unbiased and nonnegative estimate of the variance contribution of the highest-order interaction that avoids the cancellation problems of previous estimates. In an application to extreme value theory, we find that, among other things, the minimum of d independent U[0, 1] random variables has a mean dimension of 2(d + 1)/(d + 3)."

For example, the random distributions might be indexed by a categorical covariate indicating the treatment levels in a clinical trial and might represent random effects distributions under the respective treatment combinations. We propose a model that describes dependence across random distributions in an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-type fashion. We define a probability model in such a way that marginally each random measures follows a Dirichlet process (DP) and use the dependent Dirichlet process to define the desired dependence across the related random measures. The resulting probability model can alternatively be described as a mixture of ANOVA models with a DP prior on the unknown mixing measure. The main features of the proposed approach are ease of interpretation and computational simplicity. Because the model follows the standard ANOVA structure, interpretation and inference parallels conventions for ANOVA models. This includes the notion of main effects, interactions, contrasts, and the like. Of course, the analogies are limited to structure and interpretation. The actual objects of the inference are random distributions instead of the unknown normal means in standard ANOVA models. Besides interpretation and model structure, another important feature of the proposed approach is ease of posterior simulation. Because the model can be rewritten as a DP mixture of ANOVA models, it inherits all computational advantages of standard DP mixture models. This includes availability of efficient Gibbs sampling schemes for posterior simulation and ease of implementation of even high-dimensional applications. Complexity of implementing posterior simulation isâat least conceptuallyâdimension independent."

It may be used with any number of explanatory variables, even far more than the number of observations. A simple interpretation is given that shows the method to be a straightforward and reasonable way of forming prediction equations. Its relationship to multivariate PLS, in which there are two or more Y variables, is examined, and an example is given in which it is compared by simulation with other methods of forming prediction equations. With univariate PLS, linear combinations of the explanatory variables are formed sequentially and related to Y by ordinary least squares regression. It is shown that these linear combinations, here called components, may be viewed as weighted averages of predictors, where each predictor holds the residual information in an explanatory variable that is not contained in earlier components, and the quantity to be predicted is the vector of residuals from regressing Y against earlier components. A similar strategy is shown to underlie multivariate PLS, except that the quantity to be predicted is a weighted average of the residuals from separately regressing each Y variable against earlier components. This clarifies the differences between univariate and multivariate PLS, and it is argued that in most situations, the univariate method is likely to give the better prediction equations. In the example using simulation, univariate PLS is compared with four other methods of forming prediction equations: ordinary least squares, forward variable selection, principal components regression, and a Stein shrinkage method. Results suggest that PLS is a useful method for forming prediction equations when there are a large number of explanatory variables, particularly when the random error variance is large."

A treatment effect of interest in the presence of noncompliance is the complier-average causal effect (CACE; Imbens and Rubin 1997a), which is the treatment effect for subjects who would comply regardless of the assigned treatment. Imbens and Rubin (1997a,b) proposed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferential methods for CACE, which make explicit assumptions for causal inference in the presence of noncompliance and are more efficient than standard instrumental variable methods. A model for inference about the CACE based on this approach is developed which allows for the inclusion of baseline covariates and handles missing data in the repeated outcome measures. Our methods are applied to a randomized trial of a job training intervention for unemployed workers. Results suggest that the intervention trial significantly reduced depression for high-risk compliers up to six months postintervention but not for low-risk compliers."

The projected univariate data are used to group the observations according to the values of the gaps or spacings between consecutive-ordered observations. These groupings are then combined over all projection directions. The behavior of the method is tested on several examples, and compared to k-means, MCLUST, and the procedure proposed by Jones and Sibson in 1987. The proposed algorithm is iterative, affine equivariant, flexible, robust to outliers, fast to implement, and seems to work well in practice."

Anscombe,Journal of the American Statistical Association,56,295,1961-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 493-502,American Statistical Association,fla,,"This paper is concerned with the estimation of the parameters of a mixed-exponential response law, given some sample observations. Two alternative laws are considered, each having two parameters. The first law expresses the proportion F(t) of the population who have responded within time t in the form F(t) = (1 - e-Î± t)Î¾. The second law states that F(t) = 1 - (1 + Î» t)-Î½. The problem has been encountered in the context of market research, in estimating the ""penetration"" of a market by a new product; and it is therefore described in those terms. But mathematically identical problems arise also in life testing and in fisheries research. The problem is similar to the well-known one in toxicology of fitting a response law (logistic, probit, or whatever) to dose-mortality data, with the exception that in the present case the points on the empirical response curve are not independent, the basic sampling distribution being multinomial instead of independent-binomial. In regard to statistical methodology, the paper aims to illustrate the role of the likelihood function in estimation. Whether the likelihood function has a ""large-sample"" appearance depends not only on the sample size but on the parametrization."

As such it is a useful alternative for parametric or semiparametric ANCOVA models, whenever modeling assumptions such as proportional odds, normality of the error terms, linearity or homoscedasticity appear suspect. We develop test statistics for the hypotheses of no main effects, no interaction effects, and no simple effects, which adjust for the covariate values, as defined by Akritas, Arnold, and Du. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is obtained, its small sample behavior is studied by means of simulations and a real dataset is analyzed."

A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals."

An instability-selection model has been developed for allelic-loss data in which the loss events are available for each tumor and each marker (allelotypes). In performing pooled analyses of published allelic-loss experiments, however, only summaries of the frequency of allelic loss (FAL) may be available. The instability-selection model can be applied to these summary data, but naive computational approaches are prohibitive. A hidden Markov model (HMM) maximum likelihood approach has recently been proposed for FAL data, but the computation remains challenging. Moreover, precise methods for hypothesis testing and location inference are not available. We propose an alternative Bayesian treatment of the instability-selection model for FAL data. Advantages of the Bayesian approach include the availability of (1) natural imputation approaches to handle missing data, (2) hypothesis testing using Bayes factors, and (3) interpretable posterior intervals for tumorsuppressor locations. We apply our Bayesian approach to four previously reported allelic-loss studies."

Development of these techniques was motivated by disability data obtained from the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA), a longitudinal survey sample containing missing follow-up for many elderly participants. We posit a model that combines different multivariate link functions to permit fitting Markov models to an outcome with categories represented by a mixture of ordinal success states and multiple failure states. Extending the missing data approach of Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao to longitudinal survey sample settings, we use multiple-logit models to model the probability of multiple reasons for missing success or failure outcomes. Given the assumption that the probability of nonresponse depends only on observed responses and covariates specified in the missing data model, weighted estimating equations that permit the incorporation of both survey and missing data weights are used in estimation of parameters specified in the Markov models. Taylor series and jackknife variance estimators are developed for parameters estimated from these models and are presented within the context of adjusting for survey considerations and multiple-cause nonresponse. The sensitivity of marginal model results to different features of the survey design and missing data considerations are explored. Analyses of the LSOA suggest that participation in physical activity may be an important predictor of transitions in functional limitations among older adults."

The best-known method is based on the normal approximation of the product-limit estimator and has a drawback that it may produce intervals containing impossible values outside the range [0, 1]. Its small-sample performance is also not satisfactory. In this article we investigate an alternative approach that derives confidence intervals directly from a conditional nonparametric likelihood ratio. The method is an exact nonparametric analog of the classical parametric likelihood ratio theory, with the parameter space now being the family of all distributions. It has an appealing property that the resulting confidence intervals are always subintervals of [0, 1]. It also demonstrated a better small-sample performance in our simulation studies. This approach is generalized to obtain confidence intervals for the ratio of two probabilities, make joint inferences on any finite number of probabilities, and test goodness of fit of a given distribution function. The small-sample performances of three different methods are investigated in a Monte Carlo study. An illustration is also given using the Centers for Disease Control's transfusion related acquired immune deficiency syndrome data."

Empirical observation capabilities have created a need for novel data analysis tools. This article is motivated by consideration of wind-generated wave field image data from a wave tank facility. A quantitative measure of wave field regularity is developed. The methodology is based on decomposition of the wave field into simple plane waves (an adaptation of projection pursuit). The percent variance explained as a function of the number of terms in the plane wave representation is used to define a variogram, and regularity of the wave field is assessed in terms of the weighted difference between the observed variogram and the expected variogram for a completely random field. The proposed regularity measure is illustrated by application to image data from wind-generated waves. The results suggest that the regularity measure is a function of parameters describing the generation of the wave field (wind speed and evolution). An analysis of the statistical behavior of the regularity measure as a function of sample size (image resolution) is carried out. Even though regularity measure is based on the nonparametric estimation of functions, provided that this estimation is carried out in a consistent fashion, the error in estimation of regularity has a parametric dependence on image resolution."

However, dietary recall data from national surveys suggest that, on any given day, intake falls below the recommended minima of three daily servings of vegetables and two daily servings of fruit. There is no single widely accepted measure of ""usual"" intake. One approach is to regard the distribution of intake as a mixture of ""regular"" (relatively frequent) and ""nonregular"" (relatively infrequent) consumers, using an indicator of whether an individual consumed the food of interest on the recall day. We use a new approach to summarizing dietary data, latent class analysis (LCA), to estimate ""usual"" intake of vegetables. The data consist of four 24-hour dietary recalls from the 1985 Continuing Survey of Intakes by Individuals collected from 1,028 women. Traditional LCA based on simple random sampling was extended to complex survey data by introducing sample weights into the latent class estimation algorithm and by accounting for the complex sample design through the use of jackknife standard errors. A two-class model showed that 18% do not regularly consume vegetables, compared to an unweighted estimate of 33%. Simulations showed that ignoring sample weights resulted in biased parameter estimates and that jackknife variances were slightly conservative but provided satisfactory confidence interval coverage. Using a survey-wide estimate of the design effect for variance estimation is not accurate for LCA. The methods proposed in this article are readily implemented for the analysis of complex sample survey data."

Calibrating the observation weights on population means (totals) of a set of auxiliary variables implies building weights that when applied to the auxiliaries give exactly their population mean (total). Implicitly, calibration techniques rely on a linear relation between the survey variable and the auxiliary variables. However, when auxiliary information is available for all units in the population, more complex modeling can be handled by means of model calibration; auxiliary variables are used to obtain fitted values of the survey variable for all units in the population, and estimation weights are sought to satisfy calibration constraints on the fitted values population mean, rather than on the auxiliary variables one. In this work we extend model calibration considering more general superpopulation models and use nonparametric methods to obtain the fitted values on which to calibrate. More precisely, we adopt neural network learning and local polynomial smoothing to estimate the functional relationship between the survey variable and the auxiliary variables. Under suitable regularity conditions, the proposed estimators are proven to be design consistent. The moments of the asymptotic distribution are also derived, and a consistent estimator of the variance of each distribution is then proposed. The performance of the proposed estimators for finite-size samples is investigated by means of simulation studies. An application to the assessment of the ecological conditions of streams in the mid-Atlantic highlands in the United States is also carried out."

Our results are applicable to odd-degree local polynomial fits and can be extended to other settings, such as derivative estimation and multiple nonparametric regression. An implementation in the important case of local linear fits with univariate predictors is shown to perform well in practice.

The model can be interpreted as a generalization to selections from possibly more than two nominees of the basic Bradley-Terry odds-ratio model of paired comparisons. Nominees (k) correspond to probabilities (p<sub>k</sub>), and the probability that a voter votes for an evaluated nominee k is p<sub>k</sub> divided by the sum of the p<sub>i</sub>'s of the nominees evaluated by the voter. This article's major contribution is a convenient matrix representation of the log-likelihood function (2.3) and its gradient (2.5), from which maximum-likelihood estimates can be obtained easily using the method of steepest ascent. The resulting estimates can be used to determine a winner in several ways, to rank the nominees, and to estimate selection probabilities for voters considering any combination of nominees. An algorithm for identifying and eliminating degenerate special cases is given. A program that performs the calculations is available from the author. Interestingly, given the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) vector, choosing the ""winner"" as the nominee with the highest estimated p<sub>k</sub> is not equivalent to choosing the ""winner"" as the nominee that would have received the highest expected number of votes among only the voters who already voted, if they had all evaluated all the nominees."

We adopt Rubin's potential outcomes framework for causal inference and propose two methods serving complementary purposes. One can be used to estimate average causal effects, assuming no confounding. Both methods are developed from a nonparametric likelihood perspective. The propensity score plays a central role and is estimated through a parametric model. Under the assumption of no confounding, the joint distribution of covariates and each potential outcome is estimated as a weighted empirical distribution. Expectations from the joint distribution are estimated as weighted averages or, equivalently to first order, regression estimates. The likelihood estimator is at least as efficient and the regression estimator is at least as efficient and robust as existing estimators. Regardless of the no-confounding assumption, the marginal distribution of covariates times the conditional distribution of observed outcome given each treatment assignment and covariates is estimated. For a fixed bound on unmeasured confounding, the marginal distribution of covariates times the conditional distribution of counterfactual outcome given each treatment assignment and covariates is explored to the extreme and then compared with the composite distribution corresponding to observed outcome given the same treatment assignment and covariates. We illustrate the methods by analyzing the data from an observational study on right heart catheterization."

An examination of the results of small sample experiments shows that the bias in the estimated regression coefficients and the estimated mean lag which occurs when either one of the models is fitted by least squares to data generated by the more general model is quite serious. Also it is found that the spread of the distribution of these estimates is very sensitive to this misspecification. The departures from normality of these distributions are notable for the smallest sample sizes examined, but perhaps less significant in view of the severity of the other problems noted."

Naiman,Journal of the American Statistical Association,82,397,1987-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 214-219,American Statistical Association,fla,,"This article presents a method for approximating the coverage probability of simultaneous confidence bounds for multiple regression functions when the vector of predictor variables is constrained to lie in a polyhedral convex set. The method is useful because it allows one to construct simultaneous confidence intervals with prescribed coverage probability for the regression function evaluated at various settings of the predictor variables, which are narrower than bounds obtained without using the predictor variable constraints. For a family of two-sided simultaneous confidence bounds that includes Scheffe-type and constant-width bounds, the probability of coverage is related to the distribution of the maximum Euclidean norm of the projection onto a polyhedral cone for a pair of random vectors with known joint distribution. An analogous relation holds for one-sided bounds. If an algorithm for computing the projection onto the cone is available, then these results enable one to use the Monte Carlo method to approximate the coverage probabilities of bounds. Particular attention is given to the case in which lower and upper bounds can be specified for each of the predictor variables so that the constraint region for bounding the regression function is rectangular. An efficient algorithm for calculating projections onto the appropriate cone for rectangular constraint regions, which facilitates coverage probability approximation of Scheffe-type bounds, is presented. This algorithm is used to calculate approximate critical points of Scheffe-type bounds for some specific designs and constraint regions and we show that substantial improvements for one-sided bounds and modest improvements for two-sided bounds over the conservative bounds of Casella and Strawderman (1980) may be obtained."

This article is concerned with estimates of masonry deterioration and the effects of covariates on the damage to bricks on the walls of five multiple-story buildings of a residential complex located in the Bronx, New York. In this case study, the damage of primary interest was a ""spall,"" a physical separation of a portion of the brick face from the body of the brick. Eventually, the face becomes so damaged that portions fall off. The result is an unattractive appearance and a hazard to passersby. In this study, spall damage was assessed by means of three different and independent condition assessment surveys: an expensive, precise, and hence very limited scaffold drop survey and two additional inexpensive, but more detailed photographic and visual surveys. The photographic survey was obtained by photographing the walls of the entire residential complex, and the visual survey was done by individuals walking around the periphery of each building and making a visual assessment of the damage to each wall. In the photographic survey, a large amount of incomplete data was unavoidable because of either poor photo angles or various physical obstructions. A binomial regression model using four categorical explanatory variables or factors was fitted to the observed photographic spall data. Sparseness of the data, the presence of outliers, and overdispersion were major problems encountered in selecting and fitting a suitable model. A small pilot survey, in which the relevant portions of the photographic and visual surveys were matched to 11 drop locations of the scaffold survey, recorded spall counts using each survey method. From this pilot survey, photographic and visual spall data were calibrated to the scaffold drop survey data. It was determined that of the two surveys, only the photographic spall survey was needed to predict scaffold spalls. The estimate of total damage from the photographic survey was then adjusted using the calibration results. Finally, a multiple imputation procedure was used to impute values for the missing data and obtain an estimate (and its standard error) of the true spall rate over the entire residential complex. Sources of uncertainty to factfinders in legal trials are discussed and illustrated through the present case."

Unlike cases without measurement errors, the limit distribution of the estimator is no longer tractable and cannot be used for constructing confidence regions. Monte Carlo approximations are employed to simulate the limit distribution. To increase the coverage accuracy of confidence regions, two adjusted empirical likelihood estimators are recommended, which in the limit have a standard chi-squared distribution. A simulation study is carried out to compare the proposed methods with other existing methods. The new methods outperform the least squares method, and one of them works better than simulationâextrapolation (SIMEX) estimation, even when the restrictive model assumptions needed for SIMEX are satisfied. An application to a real dataset illustrates our new approach."

The baseline response depends only on covariates. The model handles both missing data and Gaussian measurement error on both response and continuous covariates. The E step uses the Kalman filter and associated filtering algorithms to update the unknown true response and predictor series for the observed data. The M step uses standard closed-form Gaussian results. Standard errors come from the supplemented EM (SEM) algorithm. The model accurately fits 6 years of pulmonary function measurements on 158 children with many missing observations.

These traditional projection techniques do not incorporate a demographer's assessment of uncertainty in the assumptions. Addressing the challenges of forecasting a data-poor population, we project the Iraqi Kurdish population using a Bayesian approach. This approach incorporates a demographer's uncertainty about past and future characteristics of the population in the form of elicited prior distributions."

This paper extends results obtained for estimation of the parameters in special cases to the general p-variate case and presents the solution to the problem of what use may be made of data from incomplete multivariate samples when the interest lies in the prediction of one character from a knowledge of the rest. It is concluded that for purposes of prediction no use can be made of incomplete samples. Under certain circumstances all the observations in an incomplete sample can be used to construct improved estimators. Application of the results to multivariate normal distributions truncated on one or more characters is mentioned.

The problem can be formulated in a Bayesian framework. As is usual in the Bayesian context, the computation of relevant posterior quantities is the major challenge. Previous work made substantial progress toward making this computation feasible, most notably through the Gibbs sampling approach of Chen and Li and the sequential importance sampling approach of Liu and Chen. Yet, there is room for improvement, because both global Monte Carlo strategies can be very slow to reach the target distribution. We propose two new sampling strategies for efficient restoration of digital signals. The key idea is to use inverse filtering to transform the posterior integration into a problem that is substantially more local than the direct formulation, leading to stable Monte Carlo procedures that are very fast to converge. In the final section, we consider extensions to the case of blind deconvolution, where the filter coefficients are unknown and must be estimated as the signal is being restored."

Applying a discriminant analysis to the total and production employment series for selected manufacturing industries, significant results were obtained in both cases. The specific form of the difference varies between the two series. For total employment, the period of oscillation is longer, the proportion of the period in which employment is rising is greater, and the amplitude is of a greater magnitude for the defense group. Of these, amplitude is most important for deciphering group difference. For production employment in the defense group, the above cited measures were important and a fourth, average monthly rate of change, was found to contribute significantly. In this series the measure of amplitude did not have as great a discriminating power as in the former. The measure of symmetry, however, was found to be more important."

The proposed model consists of a mixture of stationary and nonstationary linear models and is able to describe ""intermittent"" dynamics; the system spends a large fraction of time in a bounded region, but sporadically develops an instability that grows exponentially for some time and then suddenly collapses. Intermittency is a commonly observed behavior in ecology and epidemiology, fluid dynamics, and other natural systems.

The proposed test does not need a partition of the space of covariates to handle the case of nonreplication. The new test is consistent against the alternative, under which the deterministic part of the model is not the one specified in the null hypothesis. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic can be approximated through simulations. This approximation is valid even if the variance of the response variable is misspecified in the model. For practical sample sizes, the adequacy of this large-sample approximation to the null distribution of the test statistic is carefully examined. Power comparisons with other lack-of-fit tests are also performed to show the advantage of the test. In particular, we find that the new procedure is rather sensitive to detect a misspecified mean function, if the assumed mean function and the true one do not intersect too frequently in the space of the independent variable. The new test is illustrated with examples for the logistic and linear regression models."

To obtain an unbiased estimate of this mean a correction for bias must be applied. The table at the end of this note provides values of a function of the sample size and variance of data transformed to logarithms to base 10 which, when added to the mean of the transformed data, yields an unbiased estimate of the mean of the original variable after transforming back. This estimate is more efficient than the mean of the untransformed observations."

This generalizes existing robust methods for testing subhypotheses in a regression model. The new test is motivated by developments in modern smoothing-based testing procedures and can be viewed as a robustification of a smoothing-based conditional moment test. It is asymptotically normal under both the null hypothesis and local alternatives. The robustified test retains the ""Omnibus"" property of the corresponding smoothing test; that is, it is consistent for any fixed smooth alternative in an infinite-dimensional space. It is shown that the bias of the asymptotic level under shrinking local contamination is bounded only if the second-order Hampel's influence function is bounded. The test's performance is demonstrated through both Monte Carlo simulations and application to an agricultural dataset."

These methods are based on simple rules, determined by the kernel and bandwidth, for deciding when and where pseudo-design points should be added to augment the original design sequence. New ordinates for the added design points are computed by simple interpolation, then local linear smoothing is applied directly to the expanded dataset. The method is competitive with alternatives (e.g., those involving ridge regression), in terms of both simplicity and performance."

Run distributions of multiple object systems, although appearing frequently in applications from various fields, such as computational biology, are not commonly used, due in part to the lack of easy-to-use formulas. In this article, a method for evaluating partition functions of lattice models in the field of statistical mechanics is used to develop a systematic method to study various run statistics in multiple object systems. By using particular generating functions for the specified situation under study, many new distributions can be obtained in a unified and coherent way. The method makes it possible to manipulate formulas of run statistics by using binomial identities to obtain more general, yet simpler formulas. To illustrate the applications of the general method, the distributions of the total number of runs, and simple explicit formulas are derived for the distributions of the longest runs. In addition, some classical run statistics are recovered and generalized in the same unified way. As examples of applications to biological sequence analysis, the run statistics developed using the general method are applied to several protein sequences to examine their global and local features."

More important, we demonstrate that the log-linear modeling system used to characterize counted data structures directly characterizes survival data as well. Counted data methodologies for testing and estimation are also applicable here. Much of the theoretical basis for this work has been independently derived by Holford (1980) and Aitkin and Clayton (1980). The emphasis in this paper is not to develop new methodologies, but rather to present new uses and interpretations for already familiar methodologies."

The method produces confidence envelopes for the proportion of false discoveries as a function of the rejection threshold. From the confidence envelopes, we derive threshold procedures to control either the mean or the specified tail probabilities of the false discovery proportion. An essential ingredient of this construction is a new algorithm to compute a confidence superset for the set of all true-null locations.

A composite estimation procedure has been introduced which reduces the sampling variability for most estimates. Also, there has been a considerable reduction in the variance of variance estimates made from the sample. A statistical quality control program has been introduced to help insure results of consistently acceptable quality. Problems arose in the process of shifting from one design to the other that resulted in some significant differences between the new and old samples for a few of the estimates, especially unemployment. Apparently response errors were the principal source of difficulty, and it was possible to take steps to bring the results within sampling error range. Work on the measurement and control of response errors is being expanded."

The seismic data are indirect measurements of reservoir characteristics and have good spatial coverage but low precision. The well observations are sparse but precise. Information from these sources of data are integrated to characterize the reservoir variables of interest-reservoir porosity in the current study. Critical parameters in the acquisition procedure are unknown and are simultaneously estimated. This process, termed seismic inversion, constitutes a spatial, multivariate, ill-posed inverse problem. The problem is cast in a Bayesian framework with a focus on sampling from the posterior model. High dimensionality, nonlinear components, and unknown parameters in the likelihood model, along with a complex design of the conditioning data, complicate the problem. A fast sequential sampling algorithm containing several parts subject to analytical evaluation is developed under relatively weak, realistic assumptions. Samples of spatial reservoir porosity characteristics can be used to predict and assess uncertainty in the petroleum volume contained in the reservoir. Moreover, porosity is highly correlated with permeability, which represents the fluid flow characteristics. Porosity and permeability are the critical factors in determining and optimizing the future production from petroleum reservoirs. The study is based on data from the Troll field in the North Sea."

A weighted semiparametric likelihood method is proposed. Under the proportional odds model, the maximum weighted-semiparametric likelihood estimators of both the regression parameter and the transformation function are shown to be consistent and normally distributed. The applicability of the weighted semiparametric likelihood method to the semiparametric transformation regression models is also discussed. In particular, when the proportional hazards regression model is fitted, estimators proposed by Chen and Lo can be generated by the weighted semiparametric likelihood method under different weighting schemes. A simulation study suggests that the case-cohort design is also useful under the proportional odds regression model and the proposed method performs well with practical finite sample sizes."

In particular, we study data-dependent rules that are not constrained to satisfy the lower bound condition imposed by Said-Dickey. Akaike's information criterion falls into this category. The analytical properties of the truncation lag selected according to a class of information criteria are compared to those based on sequential testing for the significance of coefficients on additional lags. The asymptotic properties of the unit root test under various methods for selecting the truncation lag are analyzed, and simulations are used to show their distinctive behavior in finite samples. Our results favor methods based on sequential tests over those based on information criteria, because the former show less size distortions and have comparable power."

Jennings,Journal of the American Statistical Association,81,396,1986-12-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 987-990,American Statistical Association,fla,,"Detection of outliers and other diagnostics based on residuals have gained widespread use in linear regression. Logistic regression has been both blessed and hindered by this development. Certainly logistic regression requires procedures to detect global and local model weaknesses. Thus the wealth of work done in linear regression provides guides and suggestions that may, with care and ingenuity, be applied to logistic regression. Several innovative attempts in this direction have been made by authors such as Tsiatis (1980), Pregibon (1979, 1981), Landwehr, Pregibon, and Shoemaker (1984), and Cook and Weisberg (1982). Unfortunately the similarities that allow such techniques to adapt to logistic regression seem, in addition, to hide many of the differences. Two such differences are discussed here. The first examines the effect of events of small probability on estimation in logistic regression. The simple conclusion is that to estimate the probability of success p in an area in which p is small, one must observe events of small probability. This suggests that the motives for outlier detection should be carefully considered. The second difference examined deals with the distribution of residuals. Let Y be the response variable and let x be a p Ã 1 vector of explanatory variable. In linear regression with normal errors, Y - E(Yâ£x) is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance Ï<sup>2</sup>. Thus the distribution of this residual from the true model does not depend on the explanatory variables x. This is not true in logistic regression with binary data. There Y has a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success <tex-math>$p(\mathbf{x}) = \Pr(Y = 1 \mid \mathbf{x})$</tex-math>. Thus any reasonable definition of a residual from the true model, for example, Y - p(x), has a two-point distribution that depends on x through p(x). That is, each residual has a unique distribution. In this setting claims that ""standardized residuals"" exist that are asymptotically normal or chi squared are not appropriate. The argument based on difference in likelihoods to support such claims as made by Pregibon (1981) and alluded to by Beckman and Cook (1983) relies on asymptotic conditions that are not obtained in strictly binary data. Diagnostics must consider the effects of differing residual distributions. For example, the local mean deviance plot suggested by Landwehr et al. (1984) is seriously affected by the underlying p(x<sub>i</sub>). A modification, however, that replaces the deviance residual by (y - p)<sup>2</sup> appears to be useful. The general intent of this article is to point out that direct application of linear regression techniques to logistic regression does not necessarily produce useful diagnostic tools. Thus careful consideration of each diagnostic technique is necessary. In addition, logistic regression might benefit from views and methods different from those applied to problems with continuous errors due to the 0-1 nature of the data."

We show that the problem is resolved by m out of n bootstrapping under very general conditions, which provides a universal and convenient approach to consistently estimating sampling distributions of M-estimators. We illustrate our findings with applications to least median of squares regression estimators, studentized location M-estimators, shorth estimators, and robust M-estimators derived from Lr-type loss functions. We provide empirical evidence using a simulation study to construct confidence intervals and globally estimate sampling distributions."

It is applied to a set of U.S. stock market prices for 1971-1974.

Brown",Journal of the American Statistical Association,94,447,1999-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 746-756,American Statistical Association,fla,,"Hormones serve as regulating signals for many biological processes. In recent years, it was determined that many hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner and that the pulsatile secretion pattern, in addition to the absolute concentration level, is important in regulating biological processes. Consequently, it is necessary to characterize the latent secretion patterns from measurements of concentration levels. The characterization is complicated by the presence of a biological circadian rhythm. When hormone concentrations are plotted over time, the resultant time series usually exhibits occasional short rises superimposed on a slowly changing baseline. This is a result of a mixture of pulsatile secretions and a circadian rhythm. In this article we present a signal extraction approach to model simultaneously a slowly changing component and a pulsatile component of a time series. A smoothing spline is used to model the baseline, and a multiprocess dynamic linear model is used to model the pulsatile component. An additive structure is assumed, and both components are estimated simultaneously using a multiprocess Kalman filter. The unknown parameters are estimated by approximate maximum likelihood. The locations and amplitudes of the pulses are also estimated as posterior means via the multiprocess Kalman filter. Bayesian confidence intervals can be constructed for the baseline. This approach is found to be robust in simulated data and effective in modeling hormone time series."

These parameters are used for the analysis of the occurrence and association of events. Another set of parameters characterizes conditional odds and odds ratios among sequence patterns within each combination of the occurrence/nonoccurrence of events. These parameters are used for the analysis of sequencing of events. The models permit a decomposition of the likelihood function into a marginal likelihood component that includes only parameters for occurrence and association among events and a conditional likelihood component that includes only parameters for sequencing among events. The models are then extended further for regressions with covariates. An application analyzes gender and racial/ethnic differences in patterns of drug use progression. Sequential patterns of initiations and association among initiations are analyzed for three groups of drugs: alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and marijuana. Findings that cross-validate previous findings based on different datasets and findings that are novel are reported."

Solving multicategory problems by a series of binary classifiers is quite common in the SVM paradigm; however, this approach may fail under various circumstances. We propose the multicategory support vector machine (MSVM), which extends the binary SVM to the multicategory case and has good theoretical properties. The proposed method provides a unifying framework when there are either equal or unequal misclassification costs. As a tuning criterion for the MSVM, MSVM, an approximate leave-one-out cross-validation function, called Generalized Approximate Cross Validation, is derived, analogous to the binary case. The effectiveness of the MSVM is demonstrated through the applications to cancer classification using microarray data and cloud classification with satellite radiance profiles."

Its pointwise mean squared errors compare favorably with the maximum likelihood estimate, a weighted average of the isotonic regression and the least squares line, and the rank-transformed regression.

Two examples are patient compliance measured through pill counts and the dose of a concomitant medication. Typically these are measured concurrently with the primary endpoint at the regularly scheduled follow-ups during the course of the study. To account for these effects, the confounders are sometimes introduced as time-dependent covariates into the statistical model. But there are conceptual and statistical difficulties with this approach. In this article we adopt the view that because the confounder is observed postrandomization, it must be considered as an endpoint in its own right. A seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model is proposed to relate the two sets of repeated measures to important explanatory variables, and a vector autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series model is used to characterize the disturbance terms within and across the two series. This accommodates the evolving relationship between the two variables and results in a parsimonious structure in the joint covariance matrix. Maximum likelihood estimation is applied using a Fisher scoring algorithm. Inference in this model is then performed by considering hypotheses on the primary endpoint conditionally on some behavior for the confounder. For example, if the two treatment groups had received an equivalent amount of concomitant medication, is there a significant difference in the primary endpoint? The methodology is illustrated with an example."

Without parametric modeling of the missing mechanism or the joint distribution, kernel regression estimators are used to estimate mean functionals through empirical estimation of the missing pattern. A generalization of the method of Cheng and Wei is verified under the assumption of missing at random. Asymptotic distributions are derived for estimating the mean of the incomplete data and for estimating the mean treatment difference in a nonrandomized observational study. The nonparametric method is compared with a naive pairwise deletion method and a linear regression method via the asymptotic relative efficiencies and a simulation study. The comparison shows that the proposed nonparametric estimators attain reliable performances in general."

SARs can also be used to estimate the effect of vaccination on reducing infectiousness in breakthrough cases. The conventional SAR approach has been to pool the denominators and numerators across transmission units, then to use a confidence interval for a simple relative risk. We demonstrate appropriate model-based methods to estimate vaccine efficacy (VE) from SARs using generalized estimating equations taking correlation within transmission units into account. The model-based procedures require transformation of the parameter estimates to the SAR scale to obtain vaccine efficacy estimates. Appropriate confidence intervals are then based on the bootstrap, with resampling done by transmission unit. We show that the usual confidence intervals are too narrow. We estimated the effect of pertussis vaccination on person-to-person transmission. The results show that pertussis vaccination reduces the ability of a breakthrough clinical case to produce other clinical cases. The methods can be used in evaluating VE for susceptibility and infectiousness from SARs in other infectious diseases."

Such effects have proven difficult to study due to the many behavioral and biological factors involved in human reproduction. We analyze data from a North Carolina fertility study to assess the effect of prenatal, childhood, and current cigarette smoking exposure on fecundability and sterility. We use a mixture model that adjusts for timing and frequency of intercourse and allows both fecundability and sterility to depend on multiple covariates. We account for dependency among menstrual cycles within individual couples using a mixture density for a latent cycle viability variable. The mixture consists of a normal distribution describing heterogeneity among fecund couples with a point mass at 0 for sterile couples. The resulting distribution is more biologically plausible than the standard beta density. A Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme is used for Bayesian estimation of the model. There is some evidence that spontaneous intrauterine mortality results in decreased fecundability in subsequent cycles. Both current cigarette smoking and prenatal exposure of the woman to her mother's cigarette smoking are shown to be associated with a decrease in the probability of menstrual cycle viability."

Most procedures either are based on finite-population assumptions or require the specification of an explicit model using a superpopulation rationale. Herein we propose some relatively simple approximate procedures that are based on a superpopulation model. They provide valid variance estimators, test statistics, and confidence intervals that allow for sample design effects as expressed by design weights and other weights. The procedures do not rely on conditioning on model elements such as covariates to adjust for design effects. Instead, we obtain estimators by rescaling sample weights to sum to the equivalent sample size (equal to sample size divided by design effect). Using weighted estimators for superpopulation models, we obtain approximations to confidence bounds on the mean for simple sampling situations as well as for cluster sampling, post-stratification, and stratified sampling. We also obtain approximate tests of hypotheses for one-way analysis of variance and k Ã 2 homogeneity testing. For all of these, further refinements based on the concept of equivalent degrees of freedom are provided. Additionally, a general method for determining and using poststratification weights is described and illustrated. The procedures in this article are better justified than the common expedient of making proportional adjustments so that the weights add to the sample size."

If we wish to trim observations based on the estimators mn and Î£n, then it is natural to first remove the most remote ones (i.e., those with the largest <tex-math>$r_{i}^{n}$</tex-math>'s). With this in mind, we define a process that maps the trimming proportion, Î± in (0, 1], to the generalized radius of the observation that has just been removed by this level of trimming. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of this process for elliptically contoured distributions. We show that the limit law depends only on the elliptical family considered and how Î£n serves to estimate the underlying ""scale"" factor through its determinant. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations for finite sample sizes, and outline an application for assessing fit to a fixed elliptical family and also for the case where a proportion of outlying observations is discarded."

We relate mortality among these women to the time since diagnosis and to the stage of the disease at diagnosis. We divide the study period, extending through 10 years, into five two-year periods, and for each stage we assume a constant hazard rate during each of these periods. Let Î» = (Î»jk) be the J Ã K matrix of hazard rates for the J = 5 periods and K = 5 stages. The most general model allows Î»jk to vary freely. A plot of maximum likelihood estimates of the hazard rates shows some tendency for increase with stage, but no simple patterns or parallelism across stage. We seek more restrictive models, to get simpler interpretations. The exponential model assumes that although Î»jk may vary with stage, it is constant over the five periods for each stage. This model, which assumes no dependence of hazard rate on time since diagnosis, is quite restrictive and indeed the likelihood ratio test of the exponential versus the general model rejects it strongly. Not quite as restrictive as the exponential model is a proportional-hazards model, which assumes that the log-hazard rates for the first four stages are parallel. Nevertheless, the likelihood ratio test of this model versus the general model rejects it as well. We explore the possibility that one of the more restrictive models is appropriate but that the bad fit is due to errors in staging. To do so, we replace the aforementioned models with ones that accommodate stage misclassification. Using the EM algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio statistics, we find that the exponential model is again rejected, but that the proportional-hazards model fits the data. This example shows that simple models with straightforward interpretations might be discarded needlessly if covariate misclassifications are ignored. Simulations support this possibility. When data are generated according to a proportional-hazards model with stage misclassifications, ignoring the misclassification can result in missing the proportional-hazards model. Simulations revealed other points. In particular, large samples are needed to detect classification errors. In addition, misclassification models give hazard-rate estimates that can be much more variable than those of models without misclassification."

These steps ensure that DWIS can move across energy barriers like dynamic weighting, but with the weights well controlled and with a finite expectation. The estimates can converge much faster than they can with dynamic weighting. A generalized theory for importance sampling is introduced to justify the new algorithm. Numerical examples are given to show that dynamically weighted importance sampling can perform significantly better than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and dynamic weighting in some situations."

The method depends critically on the threshold level, showing significant improvement in performance for optimal and nearly optimal thresholds.

In previous work in agriculture surveys where the problem is to estimate the population total using an area sampling frame, the estimator has been formulated by assigning values to the sampling segments, so the segments are treated as the measurement units as well as the sampling units. We formulate the class of linear homogeneous estimators directly in terms of farms as the measurement unit and use this formulation, which contains the commonly used estimators, to provide a better understanding of the estimation problem. Alternatives to presently used estimators are given, practical aspects of the various estimators are discussed, and some variance inequalities are obtained."

Under the assumption of iid normal errors, it is well known that the Scheffe method produces exact simultaneous confidence bounds for all contrasts of the treatment means. Furthermore, it is known that the Scheffe method is conservative when one desires confidence bounds for a specific subset of contrasts of means. Exact methods, such as those due to Tukey and Dunnett, yield tighter bounds than the Scheffe method for specific subsets of contrasts of means. In this article, multiple comparisons of the k treatments are done not in terms of their means, but rather in terms of a parametric function. The parametric function of interest is the simple linear regression model, E(Yâ£x). It is desired to find simultaneous confidence bounds for all contrasts of the k simple linear regression models. Although the Scheffe method can be used to find such bounds, this is extremely conservative. The union-intersection method is used to develop simultaneous confidence bounds for these contrasts under the assumption of equal design matrices for each treatment. The method is based on a pivotal quantity whose distribution function is a linear combination of F distribution functions. Thus probability points can be computed using standard computing packages. The Scheffe bounds are about 5% wider than the exact bounds for k = 3 and about 13% wider for k = 6."

The process of profiling involves comparing resource use and quality of care among medical providers to a community or a normative standard. This is valuable for targeting quality improvement strategies. For example, hospital profiles may be used to determine whether institutions deviate in important ways in the process of care they deliver. In this article we propose a class of performance indices to profile providers. These indices are based on posterior tail probabilities of relevant model parameters that indicate the degree of poor performance by a provider. We apply our performance indices to profile hospitals on the basis of 30-day mortality rates for a cohort of elderly heart attack patients. The analysis used data from 96 acute care hospitals located in one state and accounted for patient and hospital characteristics using a hierarchical logistic regression model. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit the model and to obtain performance indices of interest. In particular, we estimated the posterior probability that mortality at the ith hospital is 1-1/2 times the median mortality rate over all the hospitals in the state. We also calculated the posterior probability that the deviation in average risk-adjusted and ""standardized"" mortality at the ith hospital is ""large."" We compare the results of evaluating hospitals based on our performance indices to those obtained using conventional measures. With 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rates ranging from 12% to 14%, one-quarter of the hospitals had posterior probabilities that hospital-specific mortality was 1-1/2 times the median mortality rate greater than 15%. The posterior probability of a large difference between risk-adjusted and standardized mortality rates was less than 6% for three-quarters of the hospitals we examined. Although there were differences in the evaluation of each hospital by the various criteria, one hospital consistently emerged as having the worst performance by all criteria."

Since X<sub>i</sub> and U<sub>n</sub> depend on the convolution of the p.d.f.'s for Ï<sub>j</sub>(j = 0, 1, â¯, i) and on t (the duration of fecund marriage at the time of survey), a set of X<sub>i</sub> forms a truncated sample of the corresponding Ï<sub>i</sub>. The U<sub>n</sub> also depend on analogous convolutions and on t. As a result, even given uniform t for all the subjects, a change in the p.d.f. of Ï<sub>i</sub>, such as a shift to the right, will not necessarily be reflected in observed data on X<sub>i</sub> or U<sub>n</sub>.

To obtain an objective evaluation of the normal assumption, it is customary to calculate the correlation coefficient associated with this plot. The Shapiro-Francia statistic is the square of the correlation between the observed order statistics and the expected values of standard normal order statistics, whereas the Shapiro-Wilk statistic also involves the covariances of the standard normal order statistics. In a wide variety of applications, an investigation of the plausibility of the normal (or lognormal) model is needed when the observations on strength or life length are right-censored. The plotting procedure still applies if the observations are censored at a fixed order statistic or a fixed time. Here, the corresponding distribution theory for some modified versions of the Shapiro-Wilk correlation statistic is investigated. Because the asymptotic theory used in this article shows a surprisingly slow rate of convergence even for complete samples, a table of critical values based on a Monte Carlo study is provided. Results from an empirical power study are also presented. Finally, large-sample critical values are obtained and compared with the Monte Carlo values."

Fuller",Journal of the American Statistical Association,91,436,1996-12-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 1440-1449,American Statistical Association,fla,,"The distribution of usual intakes of dietary components is important to individuals formulating food policy and to persons designing nutrition education programs. The usual intake of a dietary component for a person is the long-run average of daily intakes of that component for that person. Because it is impossible to directly observe usual intake for an individual, it is necessary to develop an estimator of the distribution of usual intakes based on a sample of individuals with a small number of daily observations on a subsample of the individuals. Daily intake data for individuals are nonnegative and often very skewed. Also, there is large day-to-day variation relative to the individual-to-individual variation, and the within-individual variance is correlated with the individual means. We suggest a methodology for estimating usual intake distributions that allows for varying degrees of departure from normality and recognizes the measurement error associated with one-day dietary intakes. The estimation method contains four steps. First, the original data are standardized by adjusting for nuisance effects, such as day-of-week and interview sequence. Second, the daily intake data are transformed to normality using a combination of power and grafted polynomial transformations. Third, using a normal components-of-variance model, the distribution of usual intakes is constructed for the transformed data. Finally, a transformation of the normal usual intake distribution to the original scale is defined. The approach is applied to data from the 1985 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and works well for a set of dietary components that are consumed nearly daily and exhibit varying distributional shapes."

Bentler",Journal of the American Statistical Association,88,421,1993-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 135-143,American Statistical Association,fla,,"In this article we develop statistical inference based on the maximum likelihood method in elliptical populations with an unknown density function. The method assuming the multivariate normal distribution, using the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix, is basically correct even for elliptical populations under a certain kurtosis adjustment, but is not statistically efficient, especially when the kurtosis of the population distribution has higher than moderate values. On the other hand, several methods of statistical inference assuming a particular family (e.g., multivariate T distribution) of elliptical distributions have been recommended as a robust procedure against outliers or distributions with heavy tails. Such inference also will be important to maintain a high efficiency of statistical inference in elliptical populations. In practice, however, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate family of elliptical distributions, and one may misspecify the family. Furthermore, extra parameters (i.e., other than means and covariances) may make computation heavy. Here we investigate the maximum likelihood method assuming a particular family of elliptical distributions with extra parameters replaced by inexpensive estimators when the assumed family may be misspecified. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators are proved, and the asymptotic equivalence among the likelihood ratio, Wald and Score test statistics, and their chi-squaredness under a constant correction are shown. Two easy methods of estimating extra parameters are proposed. A criterion for choosing a family among competing elliptical families is also provided."

It is particularly advantageous when there is a premium on the number of bootstrap samples, either because samples are hard to generate or because expensive computations are applied to each sample. This recycling algorithm is useful because it enables inference procedures like prepivoting and bootstrap iteration in models where nested bootstrapping is computationally impractical. Implementation of the recycling algorithm is quite straightforward. As a replacement of the double bootstrap, for example, bootstrap recycling involves two stages of sampling, as does the double bootstrap. The first stage of both algorithms is the same: simulate from the fitted model. In the second stage of recycling, one batch of samples is simulated from one measure; a measure dominating all the first-stage fits. These samples are recycled with each first-stage sample to yield estimated adjustments to the original inference procedure. Choice of this second-stage measure affects the efficiency of the recycling algorithm. Gains in efficiency are slight for the nonparametric bootstrap but can be substantial in parametric problems. Applications are given to testing with sparse contingency tables and to construction of likelihood-based confidence sets in a hidden Markov model from hematology."

In the setting of a tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we decompose the log-likelihood into the sum of different functional components such as main effects and interactions, with each component represented by appropriate basis functions. Basis functions are chosen to be compatible with variable selection and model building in the context of a smoothing spline ANOVA model. Basis pursuit is applied to obtain the optimal decomposition in terms of having the smallest lâ norm on the coefficients. We use the functional Lâ norm to measure the importance of each component and determine the ""threshold"" value by a sequential Monte Carlo bootstrap test algorithm. As a generalized LASSO-type method, LBP produces shrinkage estimates for the coefficients, which greatly facilitates the variable selection process and provides highly interpretable multivariate functional estimates at the same time. To choose the regularization parameters appearing in the LBP models, generalized approximate cross-validation (GACV) is derived as a tuning criterion. To make GACV widely applicable to large datasets, its randomized version is proposed as well. A technique ""slice modeling"" is used to solve the optimization problem and makes the computation more efficient. LBP has great potential for a wide range of research and application areas such as medical studies, and in this article we apply it to two large ongoing epidemiologic studies, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) and the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES)."

Estimates for these same homes were later made by professional appraisers. These two estimates for each of 568 homes comprise the data analyzed here. The proportion of discrepancies between the two estimates is great: only 37 per cent of the estimates by respondents are within plus or minus 10 per cent of the appraisers' estimates. However, the errors tend to be offsetting, and in none of the ten price classes used is the difference in the relative frequencies for owners and appraisers statistically significant. Similarly, although the root-mean-square difference between the two measurements is high (an average of $3,100), the mean of the respondents' estimates is only $350 higher than the mean of $9,200 for the appraisers' estimates. The amount of variability is found to be rather similar for several sub-populations. However, for houses worth over $10,000 the mean-square difference between the measurements is found to increase with the value of the home. In the Appendix a model is developed for the statistical investigation of the data."

In certain experimental situations, this procedure would be time-consuming and even embarrassing to the statistician. An alternative criterion of significance is suggested, the mid or median probability. To avoid computations P(Ï), the probability of the square root of a chi-square variable, can be used in the binomial, Poisson and hypergeometric distributions as an approximation to the mid probability. In statistical control of counting experiments or where experiments are being repeated P(Ï) rather than P(Ï<sub>c</sub>), the probability of Ï corrected for continuity, gives acceptable approximations to size of significance levels. Some computations are given for the multinominal distribution which show that here P(Ï<sup>2</sup>) gives acceptable approximations."

Applied to one-or higher-way layouts, the REACT method generates automatic scatterplot smoothers that compete well on standard datasets with the best fits obtained by alternative techniques. Historical precursors to REACT include nested model selection, ridge regression, and nested principal component selection for the linear model. However, REACT's insistence on working with an economical basis greatly increases its super-efficiency relative to the least squares fit. This reduction in risk and the possible economy of the discrete cosine basis, of the orthogonal polynomial basis, or of a smooth basis that generalizes the discrete cosine basis are illustrated by fitting scatterplots drawn from the literature. Flexible monotone shrinkage of components rather than nested 1-0 shrinkage achieves a secondary decrease in risk that is visible in these examples. Pinsker bounds on asymptotic minimax risk for the estimation problem express the remarkable role of basis economy in reducing risk."

Sandefur, Sara McLanahan, Daniel Powers",Journal of the American Statistical Association,87,417,1992-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 25-37,American Statistical Association,fla,,"Many studies have reported significant empirical associations between family structure during childhood and children's outcomes later in life. It may be that living in a nonintact family has adverse consequences for children. On the other hand, it may be that some unobserved process jointly determines family structure and children's outcomes. How then should one interpret the empirical evidence on the relationship between family structure and children's outcomes? The answer depends on the question asked and on the prior information available to the researcher. We seek to interpret the association between family structure and high school graduation found among respondents in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. We seek to answer the traditional question of the literature on treatment effects: How would the probability of high school graduation vary with family structure if family structure were not selected by parents but were, instead, an exogenously assigned ""treatment,"" as in a clinical trial or other controlled experiment? The inferential problem is that the data alone do not suffice to identify the treatment effect. Hence any attempt to estimate a treatment effect depends critically on the prior information available to the researcher. We develop alternative estimates of the effect of family structure on high school graduation, obtained under differing assumptions about the actual process generating family structure and high school outcomes. We first assume strong prior information and present estimates of a set of parametric latent-variable models explaining family structure and children's outcomes. We then assume no prior information at all and report estimates of nonparametric bounds on the graduation probabilities. Finally, we give nonparametric estimates obtained under the assumption that family structure is exogenous with respect to high school graduation. Our empirical analysis strengthens the evidence that living in an intact family increases the probability that a child will graduate from high school. We also report that the probability of high school graduation increases markedly with both parents' education, regardless of family structure. At the same time, we stress that prior information is necessary if one is to do more than bound the effect of family structure on children's outcomes. Any point estimate embodies prior information about the process generating family structure and children's outcomes. As long as social scientists are heterogenous in their beliefs about this process, their estimates of family-structure effects may vary."

(2) Do the migrants have a better employment experience after migration than non-migrants of similar characteristics? By the use of matched control groups it is found that the differential in unemployment rates occurs after migration, not before. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in a depression migrants tend to be at a disadvantage in the new labor market to which they move."

Several families of distributions for this level, including positive stable and gamma, are compared. General aspects of such data are discussed, including how to measure the degree of dependence. A simple choice is Kendall's coefficient of concordance, which for monozygotic males and females is about .17 and .15 and for dizygotic .09 and .10. Adjusting for cohort effects by a covariate describing year of birth reduces the dependence measure only slightly. The dependence is so small that a prediction for one twin is only slightly improved if the survival status of the other is known."

The number and locations of the piecewise AR segments, as well as the orders of the respective AR processes, are assumed unknown. The minimum description length principle is applied to compare various segmented AR fits to the data. The goal is to find the ""best"" combination of the number of segments, the lengths of the segments, and the orders of the piecewise AR processes. Such a ""best"" combination is implicitly defined as the optimizer of an objective function, and a genetic algorithm is implemented to solve this difficult optimization problem. Numerical results from simulation experiments and real data analyses show that the procedure has excellent empirical properties. The segmentation of multivariate time series is also considered. Assuming that the true underlying model is a segmented autoregression, this procedure is shown to be consistent for estimating the location of the breaks."

We describe changes in field procedures which resulted in drastic improvements in dwelling unit coverage. Our noncoverage, formerly somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 per cent, was roughly the same magnitude as the total of all nonresponses; therefore, its reduction was important. In one year we brought our coverage rate to about 97 per cent of the number of occupied dwelling units reported by the Census Bureau. Thus noncoverage, as a source of errors of nonobservation in our surveys, has been greatly reduced in magnitude and importance. The potential bias is shown to be a function of the type of estimation used: large for simple expansions, less for means and usually even less for comparisons of subclass means. The amount of noncoverage is a function of the essential operating conditions used by a specific organization; however, the usefulness of the methods and results-and the nature of the problem-are quite general to surveys."

Data-based algorithms for constructing frequency polygons are discussed and illustrated. One is based on a histogram with bin width equal to 2.51sn<sup>-1/5</sup>, where s is an estimate of the standard deviation from a sample of size n. Another approach is based on the method of generalized cross-validation. The bivariate frequency polygon is also investigated.
